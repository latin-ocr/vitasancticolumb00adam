³ 'Discipuli et (loquuta—This reeital follows close
upon Adamnan's narrative, and forms part of the
text, in cod. B. Although annexed by a later
hand, it is evidently of great antiquity, and drawn
from authentic sources. probably from records pre-
served at Hy, the school whence Cod. B. originated.
There is uo counterpart to be found among our Irish
manuscripffi, but some of the particulars appear in a
tract ascribed to AEngus the Culdee, who floun'shed
about a century after Adamnan; while others can be
verified by independent authorities.

'³ Duodecim-See iii. 4 (p. 196) ετιρνα.

³· Nomium-They appear, with sundry inaccura-
ciea, iu Fordun (Scotichr. iii. 26); and still more
disguised in Hector Boethius. (Scot. Hist. lib. ix.
sol. 166). Dempster perverts almost every name,
and, as Ussher says, solita fretus licentia, makes
every individua] an author and a saint (Hist. Eccl.
scot.) Abp. Ussher, who consulted Cod. B„ exhibits
the list more faithfully (Brit. Ec. Ant, c. 15, Wks.
vi. p. 237). C'olgan borrows from him, and com-
menta upon the names in detail (Tr. Th. pp. 468 b,
486 b); as also the Ordnance Memoir of Temple-
more (pp. 26, 27). Pinkerton has printed them cor-
rectly (Vit. Antiq. p. 186); from whom they are
transferred, with a few alterations, into the Origines
Paroch. Scotiae (voL ii. pt. ι, p. 285).

⁴¹ De Scotia ad Brittanniam.—Fordun alters the

expression to scotiam adnaquauerunm Boece to
venere cum eo in Albionem. But the form in the
tcxt agrees with Adamnan, Praef. 2 (p. 9), i. 7
