1 Duin-F01·tlzir.-A gain at ⁶94· Probably Dunot-
tal· iu Kincardine. Part of the pax-ish of Kilfinan on
Loch Fyne in Cowal, is called Otter, and was a
lordship in 1431⁷ enjoyed by Swetm (Suibhne), son
of Ewen. (Orig. Par. ii. p. 54.) We find “opidum
Fother occisum est a Gentibus’' in the Pictish Chron.
circ. 904, which Chalmers understand-<3 of F orteviot
(anciently Folleiur- Thabaicht) in Strathearn, the
Pictish capital. Ca1edon. ἰ. p. 384. See Dunjbeder
in sim. Dunelrn, Gest. Reg. Angl. An. 934.

³ Maylz-Line.—Now Moylinny, a territory near
the town of Antrim. Rath-more was the seat of the
Dalaradian kings. See Reeves' Eccles. Ant. p. 27 9.

b Duin-Att.—Mentioned again at an. 736. “On
3 rocky eonieal mount, which rises abruptly out of
Criuan Moss, near the river Ad, is situated the an-
cient fort of Duuad, of 311 ova} form, and measuring
90 feet by 45.‘' (Orig. Paroch. vol. ii. p. 48.)
Dunad is in the parish of Glassary in Argyle, and
lies to the north of the Crinan Canal, from which

it may be seen as the boat approaches the Csina„
Basou. At Kilmahunaig. in North Kuapdale, about
a furlong north-west from the banks of the Crinau
Canai, “ is a conica] emiuence 120 yards in circum-
ference at the base, and about 30 feet in height.
This mound is called Dnn Domhnul.’' (N. Stat.
Ac. vol. vii. pt. 2, p. 635.) This district appears
to have been the head-quarters of the house of Gabb-
ran3 and somewhere near this we may look for
Dun-Monaidh (201).

0 Duin-Duirn.—Girg Mae Dungall, the Scoto-
Pietish king, circ. 897, is said in the Chronicle of
St. Andrew's to have died in Dundurn, which Chal-
mers identifies with Dunadeer, in Aberdeenshire
(Caledon. i. p. 383), avitrified fort-hill now caned
Dunm'zleer, in the parish of Insch. Or the place in
question may be Dundurny at the east end of Loch-
Earn in Perthshire.

people of Scotch or Irish Dalriada. The scene of
