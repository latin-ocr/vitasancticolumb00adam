contained in the great volume of O'Donnell, and much more correct. It would,
however, labour under one great defect, the Irish would not be as good.
When and where this work was compiled, and at what cost, the following de-
claration of the noble author will set forth: ‘⁶ Be it- known to the readers of
this Life, that it was Manus, the son of Hugh, son of Hugh Roe, son of Niall
Garve, son of Torlogh os the lVine, O’Donnell, that ordered the part of this
Life which was in Latin to be put into Gaeli03 and who ordered the part that ι
was in difficult Gaelic to be modffied, so that it might be clear and compre-
hensible to every one; and who gathered and put together the parts of it that
were scattered through the old books of Erin 3 and who dietated it out of his
own mouth, with great labour, and a great expenditure of time in studying
how he should arrange all its parts in their proper places, as they are left here
in writing by us; and in love aud friendship for his illustrious Saint, Relative⁵‚
and Patron, to whom he was devoutly attached. It was in the castle of Port-
na-tri-namad‘ that this Life was indited, when were fulfilled 12 years, and 20,
and 500, and 1000 of the age of the Lord‘'”.

This work exists in all its original dimensione, beauty, and material ex-
cellence, 'm a large folioW of vellum, written in double columns, in a fine bold
Irish hand, and is preserved in the Bodleian Libraryx at Oxford‚ where it was
deposited, together with the other Irish manuscripts of Mr. Rawlinson ς
having previously cost that gentleman‚ at the sale of the Chandos collection
in 1769, the formidable sum of twenty-three shillingsy! Colgan published a
