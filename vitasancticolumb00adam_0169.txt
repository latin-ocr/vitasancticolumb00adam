founders respectively of the kingdoms of
Meath, Tyrone, and Tirconnell. Diarmait be-
longed to the first family, aud was the eighth
monarch of the race.

¹ ordinatum—Dr. Lanigan observes: ‘⁴ What
will those who abet the fable of Columba's ex-
citing a war against Diermit say ofthis trans-
aetion? Will they venture to assert, that he
would not have scrupled to contribute to the
death of that monareh, while he was tired with
such indignation against the man who actually
killed him ?” (Eccl. Hist. ii. p. 169.) The prin-
ciple of war, however, is different from that of
assassination, and the evidence in favour of St.
Columba's exertions against Diarmait is too
strong to be so easily set aside. The will of
Providence in ecclesiastical appointment is re-
cognised by our author in iii. 8, ¹93 and in
secular in i. 1, 14, and the present case: which
is the more remarkable, as at this period a
vacancy was seldom created in royalty by na-
tural causes. war and assassination being the
usual avenues to the throne.

¹¹¹ Transactum tempus.—An early canon ofthe
Irish Chureh ordained: “ Omnes homicidae, si
toto corde conversi fuerint, septem annorum
penitentiam districte sub regula Monasterii
poeniteant.” (D'Achery, Spicileg. tom. ix.
p. 16. par. 1669.) See ii. 39 infra.

¹² Act-ito episcopor-This monastery was re-
gulated by the discipline of the parent institu-
tion, in which a presbyter was Superior, and,
in virtue, of his couventual rank, exercised ju-
risdiction over the associate bishops, without,
however, the slightest attempt to usurp the
functions of their order. The present narra-
tive is a very valuable illustration of Bede's
statement concerning the administrative eco-
nomy of Hy (H. E. iii. 4), and the sagacious
T. Innes fails not to turn to good account the
evidence which it so decisively affords. He

observes: “Since Findchan was resolvet] to
have Aidus made priest at any rate, the or-
daining him by Findchan himself, and the other
presbyters and seniors ofa monastery, in so re-
mote a corner, might have made no noisc any-
where else. Now when we see that Findchan,
notwithstanding his earnestness to get Aidus
ordained priest, and the important-e of not di-
vulging the ordination ofa man so infamous for
his crimes, could find no other means os having
his ordination performed than by sending, and
perhaps far enough, through the Picts and
Scots, sor a bishop‚ which could not fail to
make a noise; and in the next place, that he
engaged the bishop to perform the function.
notwithstanding his reluctancy to take upon
himself alone the guilt of an ordination (which
it appears he doubted. at least, was criminal
and sacrilegious) unless Findchan would at
same time lay his right hand upon Aidus to bear
a part, as it were, of the guilt and of the re-
proach. When we consider, I say, and ponder
all the circumstances of this ordination,it seems
not possible to conceive that Findchan, with all
his qualities of priest, os founder, and of Super
rior of a Columbite monastery, and, by conse-
quence, that any other Abbot, Superior, or
Priest of Ycolmkffl, or {211 of them together,
destituted of the episcopal Character, ever so
much as claimed, or pretended any right or
power to ordain a priest, much less to ordain
or consecrate a bishop.'* (Civil and Eccles.
Hist. P· 181.)

0 Imponeret dexteram—Though there was an
apparent compliance with the canon os the
fourth Council of Carthage, which enacted
that the presbyters present at the ordination
of a priest “manus suas juxta manum Epis-

copi super eaput illius teneant‚” yet it would
seem that regard was not had to it on the pre-

sent occasion, because Findchan was required
