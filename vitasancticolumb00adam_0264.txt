occupied Ui Bairrche, now Slievemargy, on
the south-east of the Queen's County, near
Carlow, and were represented in after ages by
the family of MacGorman. St. Fiech, bishop of
Sletty, a church in this territory, was fourth
in descent from Daire Barrach ; and St. Diar-
maid, of Killeeshin, in the same territory, was

however, whether that island, or another si-
