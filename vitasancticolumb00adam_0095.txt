Summary of St. Columba’s Life. lxxv

and, therefore, a more successful course than theirs; but it was equally voluntary:
at least, there is high authority for supposing it to have been such. “ Pro Christo pere-
grinari volens, enavigavitffl the common formula of missionary enterprise, is Adamnan‘s
statement¹ of his motive: with which Bede's expressionm, “ex quo ipse praedicaturus
abiit,'’ is inperfect keeping. That he returned more than once, and took an active part
in civil and religious transactions, is demonstrable from Adamnanu. How much oftener
he revisited Ireland is not recorded 3 but thesc two instances are quite sufficient to dis-
prove the perpetuity of his retirement. That he was not banished by secular influence is
clear even fiom the legend, which represents his dismissa] as an ecclesiastical penalty.
Early in the next century, St. Oarthaoh, or Mochuda, was driven by the secular :mn
from his flourishing monastery of Rahen; but then 110 only changed his province, and
established himself at Lismoreo. In doing so, however, he took his fraternity with 111111,
and gave up all connexion With Rahen. But St. Columba, when he departed, severod
no ties, surrendered no jurisdictiong his congregations remained in their various settle-
ments, still subject to his authority, and 110 took with him no moro than the prescrip-
tive attendance of a missionary leader.

Durrow, 1115 principal Irish monasteryv, lay close to the territory of the plincc
whose displeasure he is supposed to have incurred, yet it remained undisturbed; and
when, at a later time, he revisited Ireland, to adjust the affairs of this house, it seemed
a fitting occasion for him to traverso Menth, and visit Clonmaenoisz the chief founda-
tion of his alleged persecutor, and the rcligious centre of his family. Surely, if tho
N orthem Hy Nem had defeated King Diannait', they could easily have sheltered
their kinsman.

111 56 3, St. Columba, now in his forty-second year, passed over with twelve
attendants to the west of Seotland, possibly 011 the invitation of the provincial king‘,
to whom he was allied by blood. Adamnan relatos* some particulars of an interview
which they had this same year3 and the In'sh Annals record the donation of Hy, as
the result of King Conall's approval. At this time the island of Hy seems to have
