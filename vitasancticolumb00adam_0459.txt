and that from it the Irish Annals derived the few particulars which they have recorded
concerning Hy.

The stated Labour was agriculture, in its various branchos, as aratio (106, 175),
seminatio (175), messio (72), trituratio (56), portatio (7z): there were, moreover, the
diversa monasteri opera- (210), such as mulsit) (12 5), opu-9 pistorium (209),
fabricatio (58, 106, 217), leyatz'o (43) on sea (47, 106, 1 10, 1 1 1), and land Labar.
(43, 60, 163). Besides we may presumo that there was the preparing of
food, and the manufacuue of the van'ous articles required for personal or domestic use.

The individua] wants of the members were the subject of discipline
as well as their conduct, and the three great requirements of the body sum-murno.
quecte‘o, Habitus, and Bequz'es, were supplied according to conventual
measure, prescribed and practised by the founder, and afterwards established by usage.

The ordinary Refection (51) was very simple, consisting of bread (109, 110) some-
times made ofbarley (106); 111111((125,155,231); fish (128, 129, 238);
eggs (348 η.); and, probably, seal's flesh (78), 011 Sundays 111111 Festivals Rtsemo.
(21 1), and on the. arrival of guests ( 51), there was 1111 improvement of diet,
consolatio cibe? (ςο, 58), refectioni-v indulgentia (51), which consisted 111 an addition to
the principal meal, prandioli adjectio (211); 011 which occasions it is probablc that
flesh-meat was served up, as mutton (78), 01· even beef‘ (143). The number of meals
, 111 the day, and their hours, can only bc conjectured. Columbanus’s Rule, which is
little more than a record of the Bangor observance, seems to recognise but the even-
ing mealss: and Ratramm of Corbyh states that it was the general practice of the scotie
monasteries to delay refection till norm, or evening, except 011 Sundays and Holydays.
St. Cainnech’s prandebant (ι 22) was not taken till post nonum. (122) ; but this may have
been 111 11 special season. such as Lcnt, or a fast-day. At this chief mea] the :remia (97,
99), or contributions of the faithful (98), were partaken of (121). lt is likely, how-
ever, that St. Columba's discipline was 111111101- than that of St. Comgall, and that it
resembled St. Benedict's, which allowed (limier at twelve, and supper at evening, every
day between Easter 111111 Pentecost3 and after Pentecost, on every day except Wednes-
