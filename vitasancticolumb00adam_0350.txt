The record of the battle in the Annals of the F our Masters, at the year 555, is as

follows :-“ The seventeenth year of Diarmaid. The battle of Cul-Dreimhne was
gained against Diarmaid, son of Cearbhall‚ by Fearghus and DomhnaH, the two sons
of Muircheartach, son of Earca3 by Ajnmire, son of Sedna3 and by Nainnidh, son of
Duach; and by Aedh, son of Eochaidh Tirmchama, king of Connaught. It was in re-
venge of the killing of Cin-nan, son of Aedh, son of Eochaidh Tirincharna, while under
the protccfion of Colum-cille, that the Clanna Nem of the North and the Connaughtmen
gave this battle of Cul-Dreimhne to King Diarmaid5 and also on account of the false

ό Cleric.—Colgan seems ashamed both of the

accordingly translates this euricus passage with
studied inaceumey: ⁴¹ camach, id est, praeliator,
