a special notice of him at Jan. 1 (Act. SS. pp.
7-9). He cites the Book of Killmicnenain to
show that St. Columba bad an only brother
called quan (p. 8 b, n. 3), the loyen of the ap-
pendix in Cod. B.; but he sigually fails in
establishing the identity he desires. Indeed
there is satisfactory evidence that Ernene was
not nephew to st. Columba, because he was
of the Ui-Fz‘rroide‚ a tribe totally distinct from
the family of St. Columba. Colgan endeavours
to overcome this objection by supposing the
text corrupted from Mac Ua-Feryossa, but
such a way of overcoming difficulties, more
summary than rational, is unfortunately too
common an expedient with that learned man.
St. Columba had a maternal uncle ofthe name,
but he was dead before this (i. 45, p. 87, supra).
He had also a friend called Erneneus, but he
was much junior to him (i. 3, p. 25, supra).
That person is described by the old Irish Life
as ennon Cluana beocnoch, *Ernan ofCluain-
deoehra,’ the saint who is commemorated under
the same designation in the calendar, at Jan. 1 1 .
There was also a St. Ernan of Toraigh. now
Tory Island‚ commemorated at Aug. 17, but he
was later than St. Columba, and was probably
the Ernianus mentioned in the superscription
in the paschal epistle in Bede, H. Ε. ii. 19. See
Ussher, Brit. Ec. Aut. c. 17 (Wks. vi. p. 541).
The name Ernan occurs in Adamnan also at i.
2 (p. 22), i. 16 (p. 45), supra.

barony of Tirhugh (note ⁹, i. 10, p. 38, supra),
county of Donegal, between the towns of Don-
egal and Ballyshannon. The present parish
church is at Ballintra, having been placed there
in 1792; but the old chureh, of which the west
gable and belfry remain, stood in the ancient
cemetery in the townland of Mullinacross, which
is still the chief burial-place of the parish (Ord.
Surv. s. 103). Druim-tlzuama is noticed in the
Four Masters at 919, 1197, and 12423 at the
first of which dates is recorded the death of
“Cinaedh‚ son of 'DomhnalL abbot of Doire-
Chalgaigh (Derry), and of Druim-Thuama,
head of the counsel of the Cinel-Conaill.'’ It
is mentioned in the Calendar of Donegal in
connexion with St. Columba at June 93 and
with St. Adamnan, at Sept. 23. The Donegal
Inquisition, sped Sept. 12, 1609, finds that in
the “ parishe of Dromehoomagh are foure
quarters church land, whereof the O'Dorria-
nuns were the auncieut herenaghes3 that the
parsonage is impropriate to the abbey of
Asheroe; that there are in the said parishe
three quarters of Collumkillie‘s land, everie
quarter conteyninge sixe balliboes, in the te-
nure of Lewe O'Cleerie.'’ (Ulst. Inquis. App.
No. v.) A small island on the northern con-
fines of the parish is called St. Ernan‘s Island
(Ord. Surv. s. 99), but the name is of modern
application.
