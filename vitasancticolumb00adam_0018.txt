with the experienee‚ the feeling, and the piety‚ which characterize his Life of
St. Columba, the voice of Christendom would have borrowed the word from
his countrymanw, and irreversibly have coupled his name with the title of
Admirable. Even in the limited sphere which he chose, he soon aequired, to
use a modern expression, a European celebrity‚ and the numerous copies of his
writings which are found seattered over the Continentx show in what esteem
he was held abroad. It was therefore more rhetorical than just in a late his-
toriany of the English Chureh, to create a silent sister beside the vocal Lindis-
tarne, and state that “ splendid as is the fame of Iona, the names of almost all
its literary men have perished.'' Surely Adamnan and Cummene are more thau
names, and if names be wanting, the Chronz'cle onyZ is not so barren as to
suggest the old lament—

“ Omnes illacrymabiles
Urgentur‚ ignotique longa
Nocte.''

Adamnan’s Life of St. Columba has obtained due publicity in print, yet
has always appeared in such a form as to render it more a subject of researeh
than of ordinary study. It was first printed by Henry Canisius²‚ in the fifth
volume of his Antiquoe Lectiones, on the authority of a manuscript preserved in
the monastery of Windberg in Bavaria. Twenty years afterwards, Thomas
Messinghamb, an Irish priest, reprinted the tract from Canisius, in his Florileq-
