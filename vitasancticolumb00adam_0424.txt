This dely probably belonged to that class of ornament, of which so many and such
beautiful specimens have been found in Ireland.

“ Pedum suum ei tradit, tanquam in lubrico verum baculum, et in omni adversitate
praesidium3 in Domino fideh'ter promittens ipsum illius munimine, eam Virtutem Christo
conferente, per objecta pericula salvum et incolumem evasurum, et monens ut ipsum

tradat''s. From the last line wc leam that this reliquary was preserved in Durrow.

7. (1111Βο KENTIGERN1.—Jocelin gives an account of a visit which St. Columba
paid to his celebrated contemporary, St. Kentigern of Glasgow, and, having related a
miracle performed by the latter, proceeds to say: “ In illo loco ubi istud miraculum
per Sanctum Kentegernmn factum, in conspectu Sancti Columbae, et aliorum multo-
rum, innotuit3 alter alterius baculum, in pignus quoddam et testimonium mutuae
dilectionis, in Christo suscepit. Baculus vero quem Sanctus Columba dederat Sancto
pontifici Kcntcgerno, in ecclesia Sancti Wilffidi episcopi et confessoris apud Ripum,
multo tempore conservabatur3 et propter utriusque sanctitatem, dantis videlicet et
recipientis, magnae reverentiae habebam—'‘g. We further leam from Fmdun, that, at
the commcncemcnt of the fifteenth century, this reliquary was still to be seen at Ripon z
“Ac nunc camboh, quem boatus Kenn'gcmus ἓι beato Columba receperat, in eeclesia
Sancti wilfridi de Ripoun, aiu-eis crustulis inclusus, ac margaritarum diversitate cir-
cumstellatus, cum magna reverentia adhuc scrvatur''‘.
