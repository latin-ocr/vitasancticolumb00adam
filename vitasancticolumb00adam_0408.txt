Of the Subsequent history of the island little more is known than the names and
dates of occasional possessorsu, from 1292 onwards, till we come to 1703, when we are
refi-eshed by the interesting report of the honest and judicious explorer of the Western
Islands. Speakiug of the religious remains at Egg, this writer says: “There is a
heap of Stones here, called Mzrtin Deasil, ι’. e. a Place Consecrated to the Saint of that
N ame, about which the N atives oblige themselves to make a Tour round Sunways.”
Again, “ There is a Chureh here on the East side of the Isle, Dedicated to St. Domum,
whose Anniversaiy they observe. About thirty yards from the Church there is a
Sepulchral Urn under ground3 it is a big Stone hewn to the bottom, about four feet
deep, and the Diameter of it is about the same brcadth ; I eaus‘d ’em to dig the ground
above it, and we found a flat thiu Stone eovering the Urn; it was almost full of Hu-
mane Bones, but no Head among them, and they were fair and dry. I enquir’d of the
Natives what was become of the Heads, and they could not tell3 but one of them said,
perhaps their Heads had been eut off with a two-handed Sword, and taken away by the
Enemy. Some few paces to the North of the Urn there is a narrow stone passage
under ground, but how far it reaches, they could give me no account. The Natives
dare not call this Isle by its ordinary Name of ΕΜ, when they are at Sea, but Island

’Mbn-Bawffireffi i. e. the Isle of the big Women. St. Dommn’g Wess, which is in the
South West end, is in great esteem by the Natives, for St. Donum is the Celebrated
Tutelar of this Isle. The Natives do not allow Protestants to come to their Burial’'‘.

The other ehurch of St. Donnan, alluded to in the Irish Calendars, is situate 111
Sutherland‚ adjoining Caithness, and gives name to the parish of Ε’ίῖιίοηαη.. It stood
on the bank of the Helmsdale river, anciently the Iligh, in the valley, called stom it
Strath Ejgh. In this parish ·‘ there was a large hollow stone, situated about 3 miles
from the ehurch, and about midway between it and Helmsdale, which was called Smyh
Domm by some, and C'atlzaz'r Domm by others, i. e. St. Donnan’s Seat, or Resting
Place. The tradition is, that the saint sat down init, to rest himself, when passing
through the Strath of Kildonan’'5.

Another chureh, where St. Donnan’s memory was held in gTeat veneration, was
Auehtorlcss, an inland parish of Aberdeenshire. Here his pastoral staff was preserved,
aud was believed to be efficacious 111 curing sever and januum, until it was broken by
