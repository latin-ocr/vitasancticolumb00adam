shrine, contributed to defeat its own object in the end, and subjected the shrine to the
fate from which its fellow, the Great Gospel of Kells, had so narrow an escape—the
shell abstracted, and the substance cast away. ¹

It is further to be observed, that the veneration for St. Columba’s remains was
not confined to Ireland and Scotland: the cathedra] of Durham also claimed to be the
depository of at least a portion of his relies. This appears from a catalogue of the re-
lies at Durham, written in the fourteenth century, 111 which we find the entry: “ De
ossibus et reliquiis Sancti Columkelli abbatis⁷'³. A representation of the saint was
painted also on the screen-work of the altar of St. Jerome and St. Benedict, in the
same chureh, with the inscription, “ Sanctus Columba monachus et abbas’'¹³.

IN connexion with the history of Columkill’s remeius the antiquary may desire to
have a catalogue of those articles which tradition invested with the repute of hav-ing
been esteemed or used by the saint. Adamnan makes mention of a Hymnal, which
was preserved in Ireland⁴²; and of aWhite Pebble, which was used as a charm among
the Pictsd; also of Books written by him, and the W'hite Tunic 110 wore at the time of
his death, which were preserved in Hye. Some of these were afterwards lost, but later
wn'tings have furnished us with the names of others which do more than supply their
place. Thus, among the alleged compositione of St. Columba contained in the Laud
MS.¹, is a poem in the form of a dialogue between 111111 and Baithene Morg, son of
Cuana, on the subject of his chief reliques, to wit, the Great Cross, the Oathach, and
his Cowl. Besides these, there were others of lesser note, which will presently be
noticed.
