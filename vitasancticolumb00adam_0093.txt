Summary of St. Columbae Life. lxxiii
near Dubljn, consisted of a group of huts or cellsn, and an oratory, situate on either
bank of the Finglass0. Here also are said to have been, at the same time, SS. Comgall‚
Ciaran, and Cainnech, Who had been his companions at Clonard. A violent distemper1·‚
however, which appeared in the neighbourhood about 544, broke up the eommunity,
and Columba returned to the north. On his way he erossed the Biorq, now called the
Moyola water, a small river which runs into Lough Neagh on the north-west, and, in
doing so, prayed, it is said, that this might be the northern limitr to the spread of tlu-
disease. Mobhi died in 545, and in the following year, according to the Annals of
Ulster, the ehurch of Derry was founded⁵ by St. Columba, he being then twenty-fiu-
years of age. In 549 his former toacher, St. Finnian of Chnard‘, was removed from

this h'fe.

About the year ς 53, he founded the monastery of Durroxvu, of which, as his ehiei'

institution in Ireland, Bede makes special mention.

We have no means of ascertain-

ing the dates of hjs other clun-ehes; and al] we can do with any probability is to allow
generally the fifteen years’ interval between 546 and 562 for their foundation.

In 561 was fought the battle of Cooldrevny*, which is believed to have been, in :t
great measure, brought about at St. Columba's instigation. A synod, which Adamnan
states* was assembled to excommunicate St. Columba, met at Tdtown, in Meam, pro·

Cainneeh, and Maidoc. St. Mobhi¹s day is Oet. 12.
He is stated to have been one of the twelve Apostles of
Erin, and a fellow-student with St. Columba at. Clo-
nard.—Vit S.Finniani, c. 19(Colg.A. SS. p. 395 a).

Thus it was the boundary between the AirghIalla, and
the Cinel Eoghain branch os the northern Hy Neill;
and hence, perhaps, in the biography of a Neillian,
it was represented as a boundary of disease.

² Finnian os CIonanL-He died in the Great
Mortality. The Annals of Ulster, at 548, in re-
cording his death, call him Fiunio Maccncduib, the
latter of which names is a clerical error for Macc-
u-telduib. The designation is derived from Ailill
Telduib⁷ a progenitor of the saint. The tract De
Mutribus SS. Hib.⁷ attributed to AEngus, calls St⁴
Finnian, “ Findia, son of Ui-Tellduib.” A succes-
sor at Clonard, whose death is recorded in the same
Anuals at 6537 is styled “Colman Mac Ua. Tel-
duibh.'’ Thus it would seem that, as in Hy, so in
Clonard, the chief offices were limited by elan.
