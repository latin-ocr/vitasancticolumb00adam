on Vinnianus; and Finnio in iii. 4, infra. The
Irish pinnen, pinnen, and pinum, are dimi-
nutives of pinn, ¹ albus‚' equivalent to Albinus,
and appear in the Latin forms Ennianus, Pin<
dianus, Finnio, Vinnio, and Vinnianus; to which
the Italians add Fridianus and Frigidianus.
Findbarr is a compound name, formed from
pmn hami, ‘pulcher vertex,' “ propter can-
dorem capillorum.” (Colg. Aet. SS. p. 638 a.)
There were two famous abbots called Finniam
who were successively teat-hers of St. Columba:
one of them founder of Magh-bile, now Movilla
iu Down; the other, of Cluain-Eraird. now
Clonard in Meath. With the former of these,
the ancient lrish Life, followedby O'Donnell
(i. 39, Tr. Th. p. 395 α), Keating (reg). Aethi),
and Lanigan (Ec. H. ii. p. ¹¹7). identifies the
Findbarr of the text. {uio innuli] oo 1⁴:03-

went, then, to learn wisdom= to the illustrious
bishop‚ namely‚ Finden of Magh-bile¹ On a
certain occasion wine and bread were wanting
to Finden for the offertory: Columcille blessed
the water, audit was turned into wine, and put
into the offertory chalice.' With this agree the
Lives of SS. Ere and Callin (Colg. Act. SS.

p. 644 α). Colgan is undecided in his choiee,
for at Feb. 23 he inclines to Clonard (Aet. SS.
pp. ..03 b, 644 a); and at March 18 to Movilla
(lb. p. 644 a; Tr. Tr. p. 381 a). St. Finnian
of Movilla was son of Cairbrc, one os tho Dal
Fiatach, the royal family of Ulstcr, and became
the patron saint of the Ultonians (Roeves, Eccl.
Ant. p. 15¹)· Besides Movilla, he was the
founder of Druim-fionn, now Dromin in Louth
(⁵ Eccl. S. Fintani de Di'ornyng‚'—Regist. Fle-
ming, fol. 44 a)3 and here the disputo between
him and St. Columba respecting the manuscript
of the Gospels is said to have occurred. IIe
died Sept. 10, which is his fcstival; and his
obit is thus recorded by 'l‘iglwrnach at 579:
Quies Flauiani episcopi [cholt's Fiuluch. Where
O‘Conor corruptly sor Finuiani reads Mani.
Also in the Annal. Ult., at 578: Quies Vin-
niani episcopi nuc [filii] Nepotis Fiatuch‚ as
in the Dublin MS.; though O‘Conor's text
unmeaning-ly gives Umaniain as the Saint’s
name. The Irish Life states that. St. Co-
lumba, on leaving St. Finnian of Maghbile,
placed himself under a. senior called Gemman
mentioned at ii. 25, infra), from whom he re-
moved to St. Finniau os Clonard. The Life
by Cummian subjoins the present anecdote tu
that recorded at iii. 4. infra, where see note.
