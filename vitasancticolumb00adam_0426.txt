3 26 A [lditional Notes. [m.

Another account of the origin of this ancient manuscript (for that such a book,
whether Martin's or Patrick⁷s, was preserved in the diocese of Derry, is unquestionable)
is, that it had belonged to St. Patn'ck‚ who, as the Tripartite Life says, when “ morti
vicinus, librum Evangeliorum, quo ipse dum viveret, utebatur, illi velut Euangelii ob-
servantissimo cultori, testamento legaverit, ex suo etiam in Ardmachia successori man-
daverit certam quotannis pensionem pro eodem seponere. Praefatus vero Euangelio-
rum codex ad Columbae manus devenit, sive illi fuerat per S. Brigidam Virginem, penes
quam depositus scribitur, eonsignatus; sive, quod aliqua habent exemplaria, Angelico
illi ministerio allatus ex D. Patricii tumulo, in quo jubente Patricio, ne in aliquas ini-
quas manus incideret, conditus existimatur”⁰. Το the discovery of the manuscript in
St. Patrick's grave, the following entry in the Annals of Ulster, copied from a chro-

nicle called the Book of Cuana, refers:

The relies of Patrick were enshfined
sixty years after his death by Columcille.
Three precious reliquaries were found in
the tomb, sc. the Cup, the Angel's Gos-
pel, and the Bell of the Wfflp‚ The angel
directed Columeille to divide the three re-
liquaries thus ε the Cup to Down, the Bell
of the Will to Amagh‚ the Gospel of the
Angel to Columeille himself. And it is
called the Gospel of the Angel, because
Columcille receivedq it at the Angel’s
hand.

O’Donnell has transferred this aneedote into his narrative‘, which Colgan has im—
pcrfeetly translatedfl. That the Gospel of St. Martin and the Gospel of the Ange] were

supposed to be identical, appears froin a poem in the Laud MS. (p. 81) beginning
Cmpcpmcep mo porreelo, ‘My gospel shall be preserved,' in which St. Patrick is
represented as describing the future grcatness and holiness of St. Columba3 where the

gloss remarks that the Gospcl of St. Martin is alluded to.

ν Bell ofthe Will.--On the word moeecci, see
note ὃ, p. 323, supra. 111 the Laud MS. there is a
poem purporting to be addressed to the Bell by St.
Columba, iu which it is stated that it had lain cou-
cealed sor sixty-foui· years (p. 1 19). This reliquary
is now in the possession of the Rev. Dr. Todd. See

with five Chromo-lithog. Drawings (Beffast, 18 50).

plained in a gloss puom, i. e. yet, received. It occurs
again in the An. Ult. 1106, where O’Conor incor-
rectly translates it convenerunt.
