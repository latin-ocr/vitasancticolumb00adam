COLAMCILLE CECINIT, WHEN CORMAC CAME To 1-11M FROM ffls OWN
COUNTRY.

Cormac, offspring of Liathan, of aspect brigth
The champion of heaven and of earth,
Came out of his southern, warm country,
Upon a visit, upon a pilgrimage.

Two wild oxonb of noble appearance
Conveyed the devout cleric
From the south, fiom the broad rapid Luig
Το Cormac's cross at Caindrujm.

Druim-cau'nd was the first name of the height
Where Dm‘nnagh stands, according to history :
Dairmaghe is its name now;

The country of Conall offspring of Pergus.

When the blooming sweot man had arrived
At Cormae’s cross at the church,

Then rang the soft toned bell
Here at Catamael'ss city.

'rhat pleasant djvine then celebrated service,
Cormae, son of the noble-faced Dima;
And to meet him came together
Our devout, stedfast congregation.

Thou art wele-ome here, thy face is pleasant,
Ο Cormae, since thou art devout:
Thy coming hither with speed
VVas a long time since foretold.

Abide here, for thou art a perfect divine,
Ο Cormae, of character unbroken,
That thou mayest be the proper guardian,
That shall be 'm my dcvout city.
