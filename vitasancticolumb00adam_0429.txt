beinge free, were given to the auncestors of the said Donogh O’Morreewn, whoe in

329

those daies were servaunts to Couumkffls: and in the said parishe are sixe gortes of
glebe, whereof three gortes belonge to tho viccar, and thother fower gortes to the
keeper of the missayh or ornaments left by Columkill''‘¹. By thjs it appears that the
word misach, being interpreted ‘ omaments,‘ was supposed to be the plural of moire,
‘ an ornament,' and not derived, as the form of the word would indicate, from nup, ‘a
month.' This interesting reliquary having often changed hands, and having been car-
ried away to England, finsdly became the property of the present Earl of Dunraven,
who generously presented it to the College of st. Columba near Dublinz where it is now
preserved. The following extract from an ancient tale, called T he Death of ,llzcc‘rcertaeh

mac Ercas, contains the earliest allusion to this reliquary :—

Cairnechg blessed them, and left them
gifts‚ i. e. to the Clanns Conaill and
Eoghain. That when they should not
be ehjefs, or kings of Erin, their infiuenee
should extend over every province around
them; and that the coarbship of Aileeh,
and Taray and Ulster, should be with
them3 and that thoy should not accept
hire from any one, because the sove-
rcignty of Erin was their own inherent
right3 and that their hostagcs should
not be lockcd up, and that dccay should
come upon the hostages who should ab-
scond3 and that they should have victory
in battle, if fought in a just cause, and
that they should have three standards,
viz.5 the Cathaeh, and the Bell of Patriclc,
i. e. the Bell qs {lae te-stccment, and Cair-
neeh‘s M'osaeh ‚- and that the virtue of all
these should be on any one reliquary of
them in time of battle, as Cairneeh bc-
queathed them3 ut dizit, ἂρ.
