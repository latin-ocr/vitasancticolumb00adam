Four Masters (an. 622), and the Calendar of Donegal, is very questionable (224). An exeep-
tion to the precedent so recently established in Hy by the founder would hardly have been sanc-
tioned in the case of the fourth abbot, especially as Bede, a century afterwards, emphatically
says, “Habere autem solet ipsa insula rectorem semper abbatem presbyterum” (H. E. iii. 4).

Son of Fiaehna, and nephew of Laisren, the third abbot. He was 8 zealous advocate of the old
Paschal obser-vanae, and was addressed on the subject in 6 34 by Cummian‚ in an epistle which
is superscribed “Segieno abbati Columbae sancti et caeterorum sanctorum suecessori’‘ (Ussher,
Syll. xi.y Wks. vol. iv. p. 43z); and by the Clergy of Rome iu 640, whose epistle on the sanie
controversy was addresseth among other presbyters, to Seyenus (Beue, H. E. ii. 19). Adamnan
calls him Seyineus (16, 26, 11 1), and refers to him as the informant of Failbens, his own imme-
diate predecessor. Bede mentions him as ‘¹ Segeni abbas et presbyter” (H. E. iii. 5).

implies that this Mongan was killed at Cluain-Air—
thir by men from those districts* This place has
not been identified hitherto, but there is little doubt
that it was the Cluain of the Airtheara, now Magh-
eracloone¹ in the county of Monaghan. One of the
parties killed there was Bonan, son of Tuathal,
lord of the territory. Fiachna Lurgan, the father
of Mongan, was son of Baedan, king of Uladh
(Reeves, Eccl. Ant. pp. 340, 353). Baedan, who
died in 581, was 8 powerful prince. An ancient
poem in the Book of Lecan (fol. 139 aa), and Mac
Firbis's Geueal. MS. (p. 491)⁷ represents him as re-
ceiving tributes from Munster, Counaught, Skye,
and Mann. One verse says ;
