were of the same line. They were herenachs of Ballymagrorty, in the parisbes of Drumhome
and Templemore (284, 285), and their name still exists in the neighbourhood in the form

. M⁴Grotty. They were also keepers of the Cathach of Columcille (320). The present indi-
vidual was abbot of Kells when the case of the Cathach was made, and his name appears in the
inscription upon it, in the form Domnzzllmac Robartaiy (319). Mention is also made of him iu
the eharters of Kells (320). Maelmaire Ua Robhartaigh was cmn Gn ῸιΓηἹε ΟΘΠΟΠΠΓΟ,

In 1 190, a member of the family was prior of Durrow.

Donogh O'Derry was a juror at the Derry Inquisi-

”idlbanach—-That is, Albaniam. The name
Dubhthach is pronounced ngfflh bnt in Scotland it
is Gallio-ised into the form Dutltace. The Scotch
calendar has a saint of that name, Bishop and Con-
fcssor‚ at March 8, whose dateis placed by Camera-
rius (not the Brev. of Aberdeen, at 1249, as Keith
asserts, Bps. p, 186) at 12 5 3, and whose translation
took place, according to the same writer, on the
19th of ‚June (Dc Scotor. Fortitud. pp. 112, 113,
¹59)· This saint, who is styled Bishop of Ross by
Scotch writers. was patron of Tain in Rossbire,
which t'rom him is 11101111)- called Syire Duicln (Orig.
Paroch. ii. p. 416). His name is also connected
with θοι-110011, the episcopal seat of Caithuess (ib.

p. 597 ς Brev. Aberd. Propr. SS. Pt. Hyem. sul.
66 a a). Some of his relies were preserved at Aber-
deen (Regist. Episc. Aberdon. vol. ii. pp. 160, 167).
The date assigned to St. Duthac. like that of many
os the Scotch saints, seems too conjectural, and al-
most irreconcileable with the circumstance of his
early lise related in the Breviary of Aberdeen: ‘⁴ Di-
vina instinctus gracia navigio ad hyberniam traus-
fretavit. In quo utriusque veteris et novi testamenti
precepta et leges accuratissime didicit'' (Brev. Aberd.
⁴11! supr. fol. 65 ba). This would harnionize with
Ireland's history in the 1 1111 century, and even until
1169 (vide infra), but ishardly consistent with 1110
state of the country, circ. 1220

ligible in O‘Conor's text of the Annals of Ulster⁷ is
very plain in the Dublin MS, moe Ιηϊ) Obbam,

could hardly expect to cancel all the Mac nAbs, Mac-

There can be little doubt that this individual was
son of Giollacrist Ua Maeldoraidh of No. XL. supra.
