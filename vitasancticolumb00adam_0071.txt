Illemoz’r of St. Adamnan. li

St. Patriek's memoirs in the Book of Armagh. It is a remarkable fact, however, that,
with the exception of the Abbot of Amagh, and Cennfaeladh', Abbot of Bangor, the
rest of the clergy were fiom Leinster and the south. At the head of the laity was
Loingsech, son of Aengusz monareh of Ireland, and after him sorry-seven ehiefs of
various tem‘tories. Last on the list of temporals is “ Bruide mac Derilih, king of the
region of the Piets.‘’ The enactments of the synod were afterwards called Lea-Adanmam'g
or Cain Adhamhnaink, which means ‘¹ tribute of Adamnan,'’ because among its results
was the privilege which was coneeded to him and his suceessors of levying pecuniary
contributions under certain conditions. 111 after times, when this assessment became
of sufficient importance, there was an officer, or agent, for its recoipt, styled the
moop ceno (Ιὸωὴηοιη, ‘ Steward of Adamnan's Law'¹.

It was possibly on the same occasion that the question of Easter was publiely dis-
cussed, and the usage advocated by Adamnan adopted. At this time also may have
been promulgated those eight canonsm which bear the name of Adamnan. Ecclesiastical
considerations, however, if entertained at this meefing, were not of sufficient importance
in the eyes of the Irish to merit an entry in a journal3 and the absorbing subject seems
to have been the civil enactment which afterwards became a source of profit, and for
this reason had special elaims upon the memory.

In the mystified style of the Irish, it is sometimes dangerous, and always diffi-
81111, to dea] with their statements as historical rocords3 but there seems to be ground

on‘giual, which the editor has examined. Colgan
understands it of ‘⁴ Ecbertus Anglus.” See p. 179,
infra. Concerning Ecgbert, see pp. 379, 383.

² Murclzu mac U Macteni.-The entry of this
name iu the acts of Adamuan's synod is of im-
portance in the history of the Book of Armagh, as
it serves to fix the date of Muirchu Maccumaclztheni,
whose name is attached to a portion of the Memoirs
of St. Patrick in 11131 volume, in these words:
‘⁴ Haec pauca de sancti Patricii peritia et virtutibus
Mun-ehu Maccumachtheni, dictante Aiduo 8181111-
ensis civitatis episcopm conscripsiff' (fol. 20, luz).
The name of his informant also occurs in the acts
of the synod, in the form Aedlt epscop Sleibte,
whose day 15 Feb. 7, and whose obit is entered in
'righernaeh 31, 700, and 111 the Annals of Ulster 31
699. Murchu mac Ua Maichtene, and his brother
Meadhran, are noticed in the Irish Calendars at
June 8; and the (1318ηά31- of Cashel, cited by Col—
gan (Act. SS. p. 465 α, n. 31), places their com—
memoration 31 mil-Marenen, 'm the territory of

Hi-Garrchon, in the eastern part of the county of
Wicklow, near the town of the smne nume.

Γ Cennsaeladlz.—His obit is in 1118 Α1111. Ult. at
7047 and his day in the Calendar at Apr. 8.

ς Loinqsech, son ⁰f Aerzyus.—He suceeeded Fiu-
nachta in 695, and reigned till 703.

h Bmide mac Deras—Called bpui'oe mec Oe-
mh ῐη emneen eunice. He died in 706, in the
elevemh year of his reign. The introduction of his
name into the acts is suspicions, unless we suppose
him to have attended 31 this synod 35 Aidan, son of
Gabhran, did at Drumccatt.

iLec Adummim—See An. 727, at p. 383, infla.

k Cain Adummim-See the names of the va-
rious Caius in Petrie's Tura, pp. 17 3, ¹74· The
Brehon Laws make frequent mention of this Cain,
but the particulars of it were unknown till the Brus-
sels MS. containing the account of this synod was
brought to light.
