sis, at Brussels, commences thus : ‘⁶ Sanctus
Kannechus de genere Corcotolano ab aquilo-
nali parte hujus insulae ortus fuit. Cui pater
erat poeta venerabilis, et nomen ipsi dicebatur
Laitech Lecerd‚mater vero ejus erat de Nepoti-
bus Mac-Guais [i. e. Ui-mic-Uais], et nomen ejus
vocabatur Meld'‘ (p. 1, ed. Marq. Ormonde).
The Life in the Cod. Marsh. at Duhlin, begins
in this manner: “ Cainnichus sanctus abbas,
de genere Connach-duinne-gemyn [i. e. Cian-
aehta of Dungiven], quae est aquilonalis pars
Hiberniae insulae, ortuS.'' (fol. ¹24·) His pedi-
gree is prefixed to his Life in the Cod. Marsh„
and is contained also, but with considerable
variations, in the Book of Lecan, and Mac Fir-
bis's Genealogical MS. (p. 730.) All, however,
agree in representing him as son ofLughteaeh,
son of Lughaidh, son ofDalann. To these may
be added the pedigree of St. Cronan, or Mochua,
of Baua, who was grandson of Nadzi, St-Cain-
nech's brother (Colg. Aet. SS. p. 79¹ a).
Brendenus Mocu Alta—See i. 26 (p. 55)
supra. Founder of the church of Clonfcrt,
called by the Irish Cluffln penso bpenmnn,
to distinguish it from Cinam pente motum,
now Clonfertmulloe. He was of the race of
Ciar, son of Pergus. son of Ros, son of Rudh-
raighe, whose descendants, the Ciarraiyhe,
gave name to several districts in 1re1and, the
principal of which was that now known as the
county of Kerry (Ogyg. p. 276). The surname
mne uo (ltcmfilins nepotis Aleoe, by which he
is designated both in the text and other native
records (Tighernach, 559; Chron⁴ Scot. 554;
Vit. Trip. S. Patr. ii. 47, Tr. Th. p. 158 α), was
derived from his great-grandfather Alta, whose
son Olchu was father ofFinnlogh„ the father of
St. Brendan. His pedigree is preserved in the
Book of Lecanv and four versions ofit in the Ge-

neal. MS. of Mac Firbis (p. 729). 1t is also pre-
fixed to his Life in the Cod. Marsh. fol. 56 b ιι,
The copies ofhis Legend which are preserved at
home and on the Continent are numerous Ju-
binal enumerates eleven MSS. of it, varying in
age from the twelsth to the fourteenth century,
which are preserved in the Bibliotheque Royale
at Paris3 besides one at the Arsenal, one at
Strasbourg, and one at St. Gall (Preface, pp.
iv. v.) Another is preserved in the Imperial
Library ofVienna, and four more in the Bur-
gundian Library at Brussels (num. 1160, 2329.
4190, 4672). There is an imperfect copy in
the MS. E. 3, 11, Trin. Coll. Dubl.; and anu—
ther in the Brit. Museum (Cotton, Vesp. A. xix.)‚
which is printed most incorrectly in Rees, Lim-s
ofthe Cambr.-Brit. SS. (pp. ²51-254) Colgan,
at Mar. 22, has recorded the Eyressiofitme'lia
S. Brendamg in which he has given three long
extracts from several MSS. of the legend.
(Act. SS. pp. 721-725.) The Life in the Cod.
Marsh. commences thus: ‘¹ Natus est beatissi-
mus Brendanus abbas in zepharia [western]
Mumunensi plaga, in regione quae dicitur
Kyarraghi: quae gens est circa oras Littoris
Ly, contra solis occasum. Cujus pater Find-
luagh nomine erat fidelis.'¹ (fol. 56 ln α.) The
legend in Jubinal opens in a different foi-in:

Rees; Stanguilem—MS. Vindobon.] regione

rayhz' ot' Cod. Mai-sb. is the modern Kerry, and
Linus Ly is Tragh-li, commonly called 'rr—alee,
the county town. And this name Trag-li. with
the prefix S, which Irish names beginning with
Tfrequently assume (Reeves, Eccl. Ant. p. 32),
has been corrupted into the forms Stagnile and
Straguile in foreign copies. He founded Clon-
