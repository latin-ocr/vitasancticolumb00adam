Ecclesia. Attaehed to the buflding on one side, and communicating with it by a door,

was a cubieulum (224) or separatum conclave, called exedrae or ezecbriola
(224), which probably served as a sacristy (17 ς, 176), and opened externally as well
as internally. Here may have been kept the clocca (33, 2 34), by which the congrega-

tion Were summoned to the sacred offieess.

The Refectory of Aghabo, with its mensula (122), is mentioned by Adamnan; and,

no doubt, there was a similar provision in Hy. The preface to the Altus

affector-ium. expressly names it by ‘che term ppomnmg (330), au Irish componml, sig-
nifying and derived from prandia? tectum. Here were probably kept the

collus (46), hauritorimn (ihr), hiberae (147), and such ferramenta, as puyiones (143), and

cultelli (Reg. Ben. 55).

Adjoining the refectory we might expect to find the Kiteheng, ‘called in Irish
coiceenn, or omem. Here were the utensils for cooking, such as the
comana. oratic-ula (ς 1), Sartayo, cacabus& and hydria (54), the nahae, or water-pot,
of the Irish. In τρῖς cold weather the focus (53) seems to have been

resortod to for heat during ‘the hours of smdy.
There was most likely a Chamber for the preservation of the books, and other lite-

⁶ Exedra—The Irish version of Bede's abstract
of Adamnan¹ De Locis Sanctis, translates exedra by
umuni.-—Leabhar Breac, fol. 69 b. This term is
explained by cormac so as to answer exactly to
Adamnan's description of the exedra at Hy: Gun-

seventeen feet long.—·Vit. Trip. iii. 78 (Tr. Th. p.

bui-ned by lightning in 915 (An. Ult.).

¹¹ Caeahus.—-The Tripart. Life tells that king
Daire sent to St. Patrick an oeneus cacabus (iii. 70,
Tr. Th. 162 b), which the Book of Armagh simply
calls oeneus (fol. 7 aa). “Pro sartagine cacabum
trium metretarum.”-Vit„ Ciaraui, c. 20 (Cod-

ῐ Waxed tablets.—Ceraculum is the term found
in some saints' lives, as St. Maidoc's, cap. 6 (Colg.
Act. SS. p. 208 b); St. Mochta’s‚ cap. 2 (ib. p. 729 a);
in both which instances it is employed to denote a
student's tablet. “ Et sanctis pater statim accepta
tabula et θνα-βο, per revelacionem Dei scribebat in
cera, indicans fratri velle suum.”—-Vit. Brendani,
c. 17(Cod. Marsh. fol. 58 ba). The Irish Life re-
