monastery, where they enjoyed undisturbed meditatioff, without breaking

Anacon'ta. the fraternal bond. Such, 111 634, was Bccean the solitarius* ; and such,

111 Adamnan's time, was Finan the recluse of Durrow (95), and Fergna of
Muirbulcmart in Himba (237). At Hy an anchorite held the abbacy in 747 (F. Mast.)‚
an anchorite was abbot elect 111 935 (F. M.), and another, bishop in 964 (F. M.) The
abode of such was called a oweno, from the Latin desertum ,· and as the heremitieal
lifeu was held in such honour among the Scotic churehes, we frequently find the word
Desert an clement 111 religious nomenclature. There was a Dis-ert beside the monastery
of Dcrry (Ult. 1122) ; and that belonging to Hy was situate near the shore in the low
ground north of 1110 CathedraL as may be insen-ed from Port-an-Diseawt, the name of
a little bay in this situation. The individua] who presided here was styled the.

charters of the Columbian house of Kclls that a Disert existed there, which, about

Sh‘go. It was formded expressly for eminio Deopmo, ‘ wandering pilgrims''; and the

r manutium—Beda says of Drycthelm‘s abode
at Melmse: “Accepit autem in eodem monasterio

locum mansionis secretiorem, ubi liberius continuis ¹,

in orationibus famulatui sui Conditoris vacaret. Et
quia locus ipse super ripam fluminis erat situs, so-
lebat hinc creber ob magnum castigandi corporis
affectum ing-redi, ac saepius in eo supermeantibus
undis immergivy (H. E. v. η).

³ Solitarius.-—The superscription of Cummian's
Pascha] Epistle runs thus: “Dominis Sanctis et
iu Christo venerandis, Segieno abbati Columbae
sancti et caeterorum sanctorum successorum, Becca-
uoque solitario, charo carne et spiritu fratri, cum
suis sapientibus.”-Ussher, Syll. Ep. xi.

2 Muirbulcmar.-.Virgnons is said (237) to have
spent the remainder oshis lzfe in Hinbzm the first
part of this term he passed in conventual subjec-
tion, the last twelve in seclusion at Muirbulcmar:
therefore Muirbulcmar was in Hiuba. But Murbolc
paradisi, which was probably the same name,
seems to have belonged to a bay. Putting these
hints together, the mind is at once led to the beehive

cells in Eilean-na-naomh (127, 289).

it is used iu the Irish version of Gen. iv. 12, 14, to
express vayabond. The Welsh dieithr-dhyn seems
cognate to it. The kings of Ireland occasionally
employed mercenaries called Oeopm'o (Bat. of

Magh Rath, p. 163). In Scotland, as well as Ire- ζ’,ι

from au official became a family name, now known
