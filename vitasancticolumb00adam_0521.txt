whom the island of Rona, situate 50 miles N. of the Butt of Lewis, derives its name.
Port Ronain also, the principal landing-place in Hy, is named after him.

ς. Οίίῖ- &lobenich or Church of Cainnech, a small chapel which stood close to the
site of the present Parish Church. The foundations were removed some years ago, and
a few tombstones are all that remain to mark the cemetery. The patron saint was
Cainnech, the intimate friend of Columba (z 7, 121, 220), from whom also the neigh-
bouring island of Inch Kenzie, formerly a dependent of Hy, derives its name.

6. Caibeal Muz‘re, or Mary‘s Chapel, situate a short distance to the south-east of
the cathedral. It is 111 ruins, the gables having fallen, but it seems to have been of
about the same size as St. Oran's chapel. The interior was used for buria] in Pen-
nant’s time (iii. p. 254), and several tombstones have been found in it, but without any
inscription.

7. Nameless Chapel, measuring 33 feet by 16, situ-ate near thc Chapter House of
the Cathedral on the north-east, and marked E in Graham’s Ground Plan of the Abbey
(Iona, Plate 32).

8. GZeann-an-Dmmpzdl, ‘Glen of the Church,’ the name of a remarkable vallcy
commencing in the middle of the island, at the back of Cnocmor, with a level floor,
and walled in on either side with a well-defined range of hill, inclining towards the
south-west, and opening out 011 1110 northern part of tho Machar. The name has long
been asubject of local speculation as to its origin; but possibly the occurrence recorded
in the Irish Annals, at 1 203, may both account for the name and, with it, for the total
absence of all ecclesiastical remains in the place. “ A monastery was erected by Cel-
laeh, without any legal right, and in despite of the family of Hy, in the middle of Cro-
Hy, and did much damage to the town. The clergy oftho north of [roland passed over
into Hy, and, in accordance with the law of the Church, they pulled down the aforesaid
monasterffl' (412).

1. Εείῖτζᾳ ΟιῖΙινῐιῐη, that is, Sepulchretum Oram', the ancient burial-place of the

“ monastery. The name is still in common use, but it 15 very ancient, as it occurs in

the gloss on the Feilire of AEngus the Culdee (204). St. Odhran's name was given to
it, probably as he was the first interred thercin. His relationship to St. Columba is
shown in the Table of Abbots (342). Fordun, in one of 1110 anachronisms so frequent
in Scotch hagiology, states of Gouran, father of king Aidan, “cujus ad sepeliendum

the Irish, who is commemorated at Lann Ronain his namesake os Feb. 6 (Civ. Ec. Hist. p. 161).
