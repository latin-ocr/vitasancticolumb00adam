'DE CETO MAGNO ²QUOMOD0 SANCTUS PRAESCIENS DIXERAT.

QUADAM die, cum vir ³venerabilis in ⁴Ioua demoraretur ⁵insula, quidam
irater, Beraohus²³ nomine, ad Ethieamb proponens insulam navigare, ad Sanc-
tum mane accedens, ab eo benedici ⁶postulat. Quem Sanetus Tintuitus, inquit,
O fili hodie intentius praecaveto ne Ethicam ciu‘su ad terram directo per latius
coneris transmeare pelagus3 sed potius, circumiens, minores secus naviges in-
sulas⁰3 ne videlicet, Saliquo monstruoso perterritus prodigio, vix inde possis
evadere. Qui, a Sancto accepta benedictione, secessit, et navem ⁹conscendens,
Sancti verbum quasi parvipendens, ¹⁰transgreditur3 majora ¹1proinde ¹²Ethioi

This tribe name is applied to St. Fintau in
chap. 2 supra (p. 20).

³ Berachus.—Colgan supposes that this was
St. Berach, founder of Cluain-Choirpthe‚ or
Kilbarry. but on the very insufficient grounds
that a dispute in which he was engaged was
referred to Aidan son of Gabhram who endea—
voured, but unsuccessfully‚ to detain the saint
in Scotland. (Act. SS. p. 342 a; Tr. Th. p.
377 α, n. 61.) Beraeh, an abbot of Bangor,
died in 663. Colgan interprets the name “ di-
recte et punetualiter ad scopum coffimans, vel
quasi alicujus mucrone punctum attingens.·'—
(Act. SS. p. 346 α, n. 2.)

¹* Euocant—This word is not a substantive,
as has been vgenerally supposed: for further on
we find Etlzici pela9i; but an adjective agree-
ing with insula (twice in this chap., and iii. 8),
or terra (once in this chap., and i. 36, ii. ¹5
twice, 39, iii. S). It is an appellative formed
from ecl] or ich, ⁸ corn,' and signifies tritici-fe-
rax, the island being, as Fordun describes it,
“insula ubi hordei magna copia;” or, as it is
termed in a Gaelic poem, (m ipiotnoh-opnss,
‘the low-lying land of barley.' lt is men—
tioned in the Lives of several Irish saints as

terra, insula, or refie, Hylli, or Halm and from
Cin mo, the Irish compound answering to
Terra Hem, was formed the proper name,
which has passed through the various stages of
Tirieth (Reginald of Durham, 12th cent),
Τμνε-ιὲ (Fordun, ii. 10), Tyr-iad (1343), Tereyd
(1354), Tyriaqe (1390), Tiereiy (1496), until it
has been reduced to its present form of Tiree.
The island Tiree is about eleven miles long,
and varies in breadth from one to three. It is
a low sandy tract, lying about twenty miles
N.W. of Hy. Artchain (i. 36 infra), and Cam-
pus Lunye (i. 30, 41, ii. 15, 39, ἰίἰ. 8), were si-
tuated in the Ethica terra. See the paper on
¹¹ the Island of Tiree’' in the Ulster Journal of
Archaeol. ii. pp. 233-244; Innes' Orig. Paroch„
under Soroby and Kirkapoll (vol. ii. pt. 1, pp.
327-331·)

⁰ Insulas—The direct course to Tiree lies in
the open sea: the eircuitous route would lead
uorthwards to Staffa, thence to the Treshnish
isles, and from them westwards to the northern
extremity of the island.

⁴³ Spatia pelayL—lt is nearly twenty miles
across from Hy to Port-na-lung beside Soroby
in Tiree. Observe the form Ethicipelayi.
