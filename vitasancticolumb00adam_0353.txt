in the argument of the hymn beginning Altus Prosatmm, whieh is att-m‘buted to St. Co-
lumba, and which is said to have been eomposed as a religious exereise after his trans-

‘Causa qnare voluit Deum laudare,‘ ie.
to beseeeh forgiveness for the three battles
which he had caused in Erin, viz„ the
battle of Cui-Rathain, between him and
ComgaH, eontendjng for a ehureh, viz.y
Rossfforathaim and the battle of Bealfieh-
f heda of the weir pf Clonard; and the bat-

As the battle of Cul-Dremhne arose in part from a religious disputo with St. Fin-

nian, so that of Cui—Rathain or Coleraineq is described as the result of a quarrel with
St. ComgaH of Bangor. The modern name of Ros-Torathair is not known, but the

take place between the saints about jurisdiction, as st. Comgall's abbey church of
(lamusr was situate close to Coleraine, and St. Columba is recorded to have been ocea-
sionafly in that neighbomhomh Resides the territory west of Coleraine was the
debateable ground² between the Dal-Araidhe, St. Comgall's kinsmen, and the Hy-Nefll
of St. Columba‘s tribe. Fiaehnay son of Baedun, with his men of the Clmma-Rudh-
mighe, are described as the belligerents on the Dalaradian side. Now this Fine-lma
was lord of Dalaradia. and is spoken of in the Life of Comgallu as residing at Rath-mor
