Charles O’Conor, senior, had a copy of ‘¹ this
poem in a very obscure characte1·'' (O'Con.
Rer. Hib. SS. iv. p. 129 ; Stowe Catal. i. p. 95);
and other ancient copies are mentioned by
O'Reilly(1rish W'rit. p. 48). The original has
been printed in Hardiman's Irish Minstrelsy,
vol. ii. p. 3723 a litei-al translation, by Dr.0*D0-
novan, in the Dublin Penny Journal (vol. i. p. 94);
and a metrical one by the late J. C⁴ Mangan.
His surname Fimz was derived from his mother,
and thus he is distinguished from Ρῑοηη pinu,
an ecclesiastic, whom the Gloss on the Felire

Connell and Tir Eoghain3 or at Chuillinn be-
side Corcagh‚ as Marian Gorman at same day3
as well as from Flann Finn, a chief of the Cinel
Eoghain in 698, whom the An. Ult. call Flann
Albus (An. 699). Pinkerton greatly errs in
confouuding this Aldsrid with Alchfrid, a legi-
timate son of Oswy‚ who was invested with
regal power by his father, but died at an ear-
lier date. T. Innes endeavours to make it
appear that Aldsrid's place of retirement was
YeolmkiH, and draws the startling conclusion:
“We see that it was usual to the exactest
writers to confound Scotland with Ireland in
these times, when the name Scotia, and, as ap-

pears by this passage of Malmesbury and others,
even the name Hibernia was common to boehss'
(Civ. Eccl. Hist. p. 278.) 'Goodall finishes the
elimax: ‘⁴ per illas insulas minime Hibernia,
literis nunqnam celebris, sed Hebrides, et ex eis
Hii vel Iona insula praeeipue designari vide-
tur.'' (Fordnn, vol. i. p. ¹59⁷ note 4.) Fordun
was less exclusive: ‘¹ Qui non paucis anuis in
Scotia et Hibernia discendo literas curam de-
diff (Scotichr. iii. 51.)

Nechtain of the Annalists is supposed to be the
modern Dunniehen, a parish in Forfarshire,
next Forfar, on the south-east, and which is
mentioned as Dunnechtyu in a eharter of Wil-
liam the Lion to the abbey of Arbroath. (Liber
de Aberbrothoc, pp. 4, 10, 124, 165.) The
Saxon Chronicle places the scene of action
near the North Seu (An. 685), to which the
situation of Dunniehen answerS, asdt is only
twelve miles distant from the German Ocean.
