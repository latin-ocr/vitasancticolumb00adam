of the cnshrinjng may bc afforded. After 878 we hear no more of this shrine till 1 127,
when we find the Daues of Dubh'n carrying it off, and restoring it, possibly suipped of
its gold and silver, at the cnd of a month. Tighernach, at 976, records the plunder-
ing of Scrin Colu'nncille, but this violence appears to have been offered to the church of
Columba's shrine, namely, Skreen in Mcath⁵‚ where the prccious reliquary may have
been deposited. In 1152, the 1111011110 or reliques of St. Columba were employed 111
conjunction with the great reliquary of 111-1111ιὲ11, the Bachall J esu, 111 the solemnization
of a compact3 but the reference in that case seems to be to the Sopcelu mopccnn, or
⁴ St. Martin's GospeL‘ Which will be noticed further on as being the great heir-loom of

the monastery of Dcrry.
Meanwhile, a fresh competitor for the honour of possessing st. Columba's remajns

arose in Pictland, for according to the Pictish Chronicle, Kenncth Mac Alpin, ‘*' septimo
anno regni reliquias S. Columbae transportavit ad ecclesiam quam construxit''¹. To

the conclusion ε “ It is evident that Dzmeahan is Dzmealdan, or Dunkeld, upon the river

Inncs declares : “ It is the constant tradition and belief of the inhabitants of Ycolm-
kill and of the neighbourhood at this day, that St. Columba's body lies still in this
island, being hidden by pious pcople, at the time of the new Reformation‚ in some se-
cure and pn'vate place 111 or about the church, as it used frequently to be 111 former
ages during the ravages of the infidel Danes; and not only the inhabitants of Yeolm-
kill, and those of all our Western Islands, and of all the Highlands in general, but all
the Scots look upon the pretendcd translation of S. Columba's body to Ireland as fabu-
lous’⁷¹‘. But this is declamation: for in the next page the writer adduces evidence

signifies articles of vener-atlon. such as the crozier,
books, or vestments, of a saint, upon which oaths
used in after times to be administered. See colgan,
Acta SS. p. 127 b, n. 5. The old word denoting
the bones of a saint is mnpcpo, which is ex-
plained by the modern ccum. See note ¹¹¹, supra.
