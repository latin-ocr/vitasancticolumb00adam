Churches of the Occiderit, either in those ages
or ours. For by this relation it appears that
in Ycolmkill a priest, even the abbot S. Co—
lumba himself, looked upon a bishop so far su-
perior to him. that he would not presume, eren
though invited, to concelebrate or celebrate
the holy mysteries jointly with him.⁷· (Civil
and Eecl. Hist. p. 175.)

ί· Avunculum.-“Ernaan sancti avunculus Co-
lumba& is mentioned in the Epilogus ofCod. B.
as one of the twelve followers of the saint.
Being brother of Ethnea, St. Columba's mo<
ther, he was son of Dima. son of Noe, and a
descendant of Cathaeir Mor. On account of
his grandfather's name, Colgan ideutifies him,
among twenty-sixErnans in the calendar, with
St. Ernin or Mernoc of Rath-Noe in Hy Garr-
chon, whose day is Aug. 183 but in this he errs.
See note ἰ, p. 25 supra. On the other hand,
this cannot be the Mernoc of the Scotch ca-
lendar at the 25th of October, nor St. Marnan
ofthe 2nd of March, for both ofthese are styled
bisbops, while the individual iu the text is
stated to be a presbyter. It is to be obser-ved
that Ernan, Ernin, Mer-noc, and Ferreolus are
different forms of the same name, and inter-
changeable. See the note on Ferreolus or Er-

nene, iii. 23, ξ 4, infra. St. Columba had a
nephew, also called Mernoc or Ernan, who

was son ofhis sister Cumau. AEngus, de Matr.

¹³ Hinba insula-See ii. 24, iii. 5, 17· 8, 23,
ξφ Hz'nbina insula, i. 21‚supr‹1. It has not

yet been identified, and unfortunately the clues
afforded by the writer are very slight. How-

ever, from iii. 5 and 18, it may reasonably be
conjectured to have been north of, and not fai·
distant from, Hy. The island Canna, which
bears some resemblance in namo, lies about
four miles north-west of Rum. Its chureh, of
which the ruins and a small cross existed in
1772, was named from St. Columba. The par-
sonage os the island belonged to the abbot of
Hy, and the vicarage to the bishop. (Mar-

ii. pt. 1, p. 339; Collectan. de Reb. Alban. pp.
2, 33 Old Statist. Survey, vol. xvii. pp. 272,

was what is since called Ouyst or the Long
Island.” (Civil. Eecl. Hist. p. 189.) Iinmba,
the reading in the Lives by Cummian, John os
‘l'inmuth‚ and O’Donnell⁷ and in some MSS. ot'
Adamnan, be correct, the name may have its
origin in the old Irish word imbue (Imbalz),
