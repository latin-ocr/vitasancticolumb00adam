readings do not appear under the text. But the omission is repaired in some
measure by the discovery that Cod. B is in general a faithful representative
of this manuscript. On becoming aware of its present condition, the editor
took the opportunity, while the present sheet was at the press, of going over
to London to collate the newly revived authority, and the result will be found
at p. 456, seqq„ of the present work.

The volume contains the same number of leavesw that it did before the
fire, though they are all more or less damaged at the top, while those near the
beginning and end have been nearly destroyed. The Life of St. Columba
occupies from fol. 19² ab to 217 αα of the present numbering. There are
some chasms in the volume not caused by the fire, and which are not noticed
in the pagination, namely, between fols. 194, 195, where the text of Lib. i. from
end of cap. 2 to end of 22 is wanting 3 and between fols. 196, 197, where the
text of Lib. i. from middle of cap. 36 to end of 49 is likewise wanting. This
deficiency subtracts much more matter from the tract than the fire has done.
However, even in its doubly mutilated condition, this copy is extremely
valuable, and ranks next to Cod. A in correctness and historical importance.
It contains the text of the full recension, with the capitula and tituli ,- and so
closely resembles B, that the latter may be confidently pronounced to have
been copied from a common Scotch originalx. The names of St. Columba’s
disciples and kinsmeny, as in B, but somewhat more accurately given, succeed
the Life, in the form of an ordinary chapter, and this again by an epilogue
consisting of twenty-five Leonine hexameter-s& Abp. Ussher, who consulted
this manuscript, and cites it on four occasions, has printed eleven of these
Father Innes also transcribed them, and partly promised “a full
copy” to be inserted in the Appendix to his History. However, they never
appeared, and they now are printed sor the first time at full length, some
chasms in the early lines being supplied in brackets from the portion published
