founded by St. Columba, but acknowledging St. Adamnan, or Eunan, as its patron, a
preference probably arising out of his maternal connexion With the original occupants
of the district. Concerning Adamnan’s early history not one particle of information
remains, nor even a legendq, save the following aneedote in the life of Finnachta the
Festive, a chief of the Southern Hy Nem, and subsequently monareh of Ireland:
“Not long after 11115, Finnaehta came, with a numerous cavalcade, to the house of his
sister, whither he was invited to be her guest. As they were riding along the way,
they met Adamnan, then a schoolboy, who was travelling upon the same road, with a
jar of milk upon his back. And as he fied from the way, before the cavaleade‚ he
lmocked 1115 1001 against a stone, and stumbled, and the jar fell from his back and was
broken. Upon which Pinnachta said, Thou shalt receive protection, O student, from
me, and hc prayed him not to bo sorrowful. Then said Adamnan, O good man, Ι
have cause for grief, for there are three goodly students in one house, and three more
of us are attendants upon them. And how we act is this: one attendant from among
us goes out in tum to collect sustenance for the other five ; audit was my turn to-day,
but what Ι had gathered for them has been spiHed upon the ground3 and, what grieves
me more, the borrowed jar is broken, and 1 have not wherexm'th to pay for it.” Such
is the story, which probably was the creation of a later age, to introduce a historical
reality, the intimacy of Adamnan with Finnachta, and his subsequent interference
with him. It transports St. Adamnan, in his youth, from Donegal to Meath; but this
is no violence, for St. Columba, before him, studied at 0101111111ῐ in Meath, and read
with Gemman in a plain of Leinster³3 nor was it inconsistent with thc severity of mo-
nastic discipline, even in one 110ny born, to derive his susteuance from eleemosynary
sources. But the lesson in the Breviary of Aberdeen forgets all propriety when it
places Adamnan's novitiate under St. Columba‘, and assigns to the latter the jus patro-
