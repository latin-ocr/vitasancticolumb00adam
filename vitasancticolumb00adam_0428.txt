10. Boon or Kietis—This wonderful manuscn’pt was preserved at Kells, in the
county of Meath, at the time that Archbishop Ussher wrote his Antiquities of the Bri-
tish Churohes‚ as appears from his words cited in the preceding article. It had existed
there for many centuries‚ and was traditionally called the Book of Columcffle. The
costly shrine with which it was enclosed nearly proved its destruction in the beginning
of the eleventh century, as we leam from the Annals of Ulster, as also the Four Masters
at 1006, where it is related that'“ the Great Gospel of Columcille was stolen at night
from the western sacristy of the great church of Cenannus. This was the principal
relic of the western world, on account of its remarkable cover. And it was found after ,
two months and twenty days, its gold having been stolen off, and a sod over it.” For-
tunately‚ the manuscript itself sustained little injury (it reeeired more from the plouqlt
of a modern bookbindcr), and in the course of the following century its blank pages
were considered a fit depository for copies of certain eharters of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, connected with the endowments of Kellsb. Archbishop Ussher became
possessed of this manuscript, and after his death it was in great danger of being lost:
but it escaped, and on the Restoration it came, with what remained of the arehbishop's
library, “ cx dono Caroli 11.” into the custody of Trinity College, Dublin, where it re-
mains, the admiration and astonishment of every one who examines it.

1 1. Tin: Marica—A manuscript, but of what, is unknown3 for, conversely to the
fate of the Books of Kells and Durrow, the ease remains, but its contents are gone.
The eustody of this reliquary was hereditary in the family of O'Morison, who were the
herenachs of Clonmany, a parish in Inishowen, and it continued in their possession till
the abolition of old chureh tenures reduced them to a state of penury, and they were
induced to part with it. The ease is of wood, overlaid with wrought silver, and is or-
namented with ecclesiastieal figures resembling those on the case of the Cathach, as
may be seen in the published drawing& An inscription in two lines appears on the.
upper side in these words:

The keeper of the reliquary in 1609 was Donogh O’Morison, who was a juror at an 111-μ
quisition sped that year at Lifford, where it was found that a quarter named Donally
was “ fi‘ec to Donnogh &Mon-ewen, the abbots’ corbe and the busshop Derrie's here-
nagh of those three quarters: that the other three quarters of the said six quarters
church land were given by the O Dogherties and O Donnells to Collumkill, as a dedi-
