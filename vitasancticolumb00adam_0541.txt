taniae plagas incolunt, jamdudum monachis Scottorum tradita, eo quod illis praedican-
tibus fidem Christi perceperint.” On the other hand, Tighernach the annalist, in
recording the death of the above Conall, adds, qui obtulit insulam Ia Colaz'm-cz'lle; and
the same assertion is in the Annals of Ulster. Irish authorities, however, are not
unanimous ι the Liber Hymnorum, a most venerable witness (17, 260), when treating
of St. Columba's mission to Alba, states: Brw'dc' autem filius Melelzon reyebat Pictos teme,
et ipse immolari& Columbo hl, ubi Oolumb eum efflet annorum lxxvii. sepultus est (p. z 1).
It is a thousand years since those words were written in that book! Now, in weigh-
ing this evidence, there are collateral considerations to be taken into account 2—1. The
Fergusian colony was only fifty-seven years settled in Britain when St. Columba
arrived, and therefore was not likely either to have acquired much strength, or to have
pushed its dominions much beyond its original bounds; but Hy lies sar to the north,
and is, moreever, at 1110 remote side of a large, independent, island. 2. A very valiant
prince, and, as Bcde designates him, rex potentissimus, now governed the Picts, and
that the Scots had not been uniformiy successful, even in their own side of the country,
appears firom the entry in Tighemach at 560: bopp 5011110111 moe Domongmpc 1¹¹

Brufflhe, son of Maelcon, king of the Picts.’ Which two oecurrences the Dublin copy
of the Annals of Ulster brings into close connexion, Mors Gabram mic Domanqairt,

rank of Conall as a prince was of a subordinate nature, appears from the term corpeocli
applied to hjm by the Four Masters at 565 z which word denotes in Irish only lomb,
in the fourth grade of authority. Further‚ 111 evidence of the limited rule of Conall,
may be mentioned 1115 peche, or predatory expedition, with Colman Beg, to the Westem
Isles (Chron. Hyens. 568), an exploit which he would hardly have undertaken in his
own dominions. 4. Finally, if Hy were at this time inside the Dalriadic territory, the
donation of it would rest rather with the chief of the house of Lorn, who wcrc the
nearest neighbours, than with the chief of the house of Comghall, whose district lay at
a considerable distance to thc south-east. Of the previous occupatiori of Hy, whether
by two bishopS‚ according to the Irish Lifek; or by Gouran, according to Fordun (418);

more modern times, the Scotch had an officer in the

office was termed Tuseachdeora (ib. p. 172 ,κ Chal<
