day3 and St. Columba, whose influence was
now constmed by a ten years’ successful admin-
istration of Hy in addition to his royal de-
scent, occupiedthe same relation to the Dalriadic
kings that the abbot of Armagh did to the so—
vereigns of Ireland. There was this difference,
however, in the systems, that the Dalriadie
dynasty commenced under Christian auspices,
whereas the sovereignty of Ireland had des-
cended from Pagan times, and had probably
conveyed into Christian ages a Pagan mode of
inauguration. The earliest notice we have of
ecclesiastical interference in the confirmation
of royalty in Ireland, is found in the Annals of
Ulster. A. C. 992, where it is recorded that the
Coarb of St. Patrick, ῃο erile& 5110'0 γηδὴ

poenulo, contulit qradum reqis super Aedum
filium Domnalli in conspectu conqreqationis Pa-
tricii. This, however, was only the case of a
provincial king, and was probably the com-
meucement of the practice. But see O'Dono-
van, Hy-Fiachr. p. 452; Four Mast. 99²³
R. King, Memoir of Primacy, p. 38. Martene,
treating De solemni Requm benedictione, has
the following observation on the present oc-
currence: “Antiquissima omnium, quas inter
legendum mihi reperire licuit, ea est quae a
Columba abbate Hiensi faeta est jussu angeli
in Aidanum Scotorum regem, cujus meminit
Cumeneus Albus in Vita S. Columbae n. 5.
Saec. 1. Benedictino. Sed ea supponit huuc
ritum tanquam usu jam receptissimum, quippe
ait angelum Domini, ad dictum abbatem mis-
sum, qui in manu vitreum ordinationis reyum
habebat librum: Quae verba plane innuunt jam
antea reges ordinatos fuisse. Sed in Aidani
benedictione illud singulare occurrit, quod non
ab episcopo, sed ab abbate fuerit ordinatus.''—

De Antiq. Eecl. Ritib. ii. 10 (tom. ii. p. 213 a,

presented by the angel to have been a formu-
lary, and suggested the mistaken notion to
Innes, who refers to the passage just quoted.

Ι* Οιιηιηιεηεπιε Albus-Son of Ernan, son of
Fiachna, of the race of Conall Gulban. He was
seventh abbot of Hy, and presided from 657 to
669. The name is variously written in Irish
Cumine (Tigh. 661), Cumome (id. 669), Cum-
rume (Four Mast. 668), Cummem (Mar. Gorm.;
Cal. Dungall. 24 Fen), Comme (Mart. Taml.)
To which is added the surname (11le (Tigh.
661, 669), or Ριοηη (Mart. Taml. ς Cal. Dun-
gall.; Four Mast.), rendered Albus iii the pre-
sent instance, and An. Ult. 668. The writer
of the Paschal Epistle printed by Ussher (Syll.
xi.) calls himself Came-anus, and is generally
supposed to have been the same as Cummineus
Albus, though the identity is very question-
able. The abbot of Hy died in 669, Feb. 24,
which is the day of his commemoration in the
Calendars. Colgan has collected all the facts
and conjectures that are recorded of him, at
Feb. 24. (Act. SS. pp. 408-411.)

¹Libro quem scripsit.—Colgan printed an
anonymous Life of St. Columba, which had been
taken from a manuscript of Miraeus, at Ant-
werp, and was included in Belsortius‘ supple—
ment to Sui-ius. He pronounced it ancient. and
placed it first in order in his collection, but
expressed no opinion of its authorsliip. (Tr.
Th. pp. 321—324.) Subsequently there appeared
in Mabillon's Aeta Sanct. Bened. Ord. (vol. i.
pp. 342-349‚ Venet. 1733) a Life of St. Co-
lumba, differing only, as the Bollandist editor
observes, ‘⁴ in aliquibus loquendi formulis‚'¹
from that in Colgan. It. was printed from a
manuscript of Compeigne (Compendiensis mo-
