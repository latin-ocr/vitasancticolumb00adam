³ &emonam—st. Columba is represented as
engaged ou various occasions in personal en-
counters with demons; as, when he went to the
aid of Cainneeh of Aghabo, and Eugenius of
Ardstraw (O'Donnell, ii. 22, Tr. Th. p. 412 b);
and of Ruadhan of Lothra (Tr. Th. p. 461 a,
c. 39). But his most brilliant achievemeut is
related in the Irish legend of King Brandubh’s
death, of which the following is a literal trans-
lation: “Brandubh was killed on the morrow,
and demons carried off his soul into the air.
And Maedhog [abbot of Ferus] heard the wail
of his soul as it was undergoing pain, while he
was with the reapers. And he went into the
air, and began to battle with the demons. And
they passed over Hy3 and Columkille heard
them while he was writing3 and he stuck the
style [61101b. graphium] into his eloak, and
went to the battle to the aid of Maedhog, in

defence of Brandubh's soul. And the battle
passed over Rome, and the style fell ont of
Columkille's cloak, and dropped in front of
Gmgory, who took it up in his hand. Colum-
kille followed the soul of Brandubh to heaven.
W'hen he reached it, the congregation of hea-
ven were at Celebration, namely, Te decet
hymnus, and Benedic anima mea, and Luudute
pueri Dominum; and this is the beginning of
the Celebration of heaven. Columbkille did the
same as the people os heaven. And they brought
Brandubh's soul back to his body again. Co-
lumbkille tat-ried with Gregory3 aud brought
away Gregory's brooch [Dente] with him, and
it is the hereditary brooch [oelffi moechm,
literally testamentary brooch, being an heir-
loom in Hy, as the cto-5 un euouclico, or tes-
tamentary bell, was in Armagh] of the coarb of
Columkille to this day. And he left his style
with Gregory.”-—Lib. Lecan, fol, 183 α. The
legend is transferred from the Irish original
into O'Donnell's Life. See Colgan's abridg-
ment, iii. 45 (Tr. Th. p. 439 α).
