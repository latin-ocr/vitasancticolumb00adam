ilsemoir of St. A damnem. lv

nanus Mageonensem Ecclesiam, per septem annos indefesse rexit. Inde ad lonensem
Abbatiam perrexit, et ibi feliciter in Domino obiit et sepultus est.⁷' Now, though this
statement is open, in the first place, to the grave objection that St. Geraldus was later
than Adamnan instead of prior to him, and, in the second, that a monastery founded
twenty years previously as an asylum for adherents to the old Easter, was not a likely
place to entertain the professed advocate of innovation3 still, the story seems to b<—
wrought upon an ancient tradition that St. Adamnan traversed Ireland on ecclesiastic-al

duty, and spent some years therein‚ and that, having gone back to Hy at the end of
about seven years, he died soon after.

The narrative of Adamnan’s proceedingS‚ from his first visit to the court of Aldfrid
down to his last stay in Ireland, as given in Mac F irbis’s MS. Annals, is so amusingly
characteristic of native simplicity, that it is entitled, notwithstanding its looseness,
to find a place among more explicit records. “An. 896 [recte 796] In this year
the men of Erin consented to receive jiu'isdiction and one rule from Adamnan respect-
ing the celebration of Easter 011 Sunday, on the fourteenth of the moon of April; and
the coronal tonsure of Peter was performed upon the clerics of Erin, forthere had been
great varianae in Erin on these questions, until then, inasmuch as some of the clen'os
of Erin were 111 the habit of celebrating Easter 011 Sunday the 14th of the moon of
April, and had the coronal tonsure of Peter the Apostle, following in the steps of
Patrick‘; others, following Columeille, celebrated Easter on the fourteenth of the
moon of April, whatever day of the 1110011(ἰ that fourteenth should happen to fall, and
had the coronal tonsure of Simon Maguse. A third party followed neither the sect of
Patrick nor the sect of Columcille‚ so that the clergy ot* Erin held many synods, and

from this, namely, the Besa-mors, and the very great deffih, and many ‹h'seases; and

before Gerailt. The passage plainly states that “the
Bishop of Mayo-Saxonum of Gerald diedss' and this
addition of Gerald‘s name is a prolepsis. The Life
of St. Gerald states that he came to Ireland accom-
panied by three brothers, one of whom was Beriker-
tus. He was the St. Beretchert of Tulach-leis, now
Tullylease, in the county of Cork, whose day in the
Calendar is Dec. 6, aud whose obit is entered in the
110111- Masters at 839. If this date be correct, St.
Gerald must come down to circ. 800.
