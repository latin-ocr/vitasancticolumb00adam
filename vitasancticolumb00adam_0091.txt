Summary of St. Columba’s Life.

to his diligent attendance at the chureh of his youthful sojourn. The tradition of the
country is, that he was baptized at Tulach-Dubhglaise, now called 'l‘enrple-Douglas⁷,
a place about half way between Gartan and Letterkenny, where there is a cemetery
of considerable extent, containing the rooflcss walls of a large chapel, and, at a short
distance 011 the north-east, within the enclosure, a square, 01ονοῖοᾱ space, which ap—
pears to have been artificially formed, and to be the spot which in O'Donnell’s time
was coupled with the memory of the saint'.

The place where St. Columba is said to have spent the principal portion of his boy-
hood was Doire-Eithne¹, a hamlet in the same territory, which afterwards exchanged
this name, signifying Roboretum Ezthneae, sor Cill-nme-Nenaz'ffl, in commemoration, it
is supposed, of the ‘¹ Sons of Enan,” whose mother was one of St. Coluniba's sistcrs¹.
The absence of any mention of this place in the ancient Irish Life, coupled with the
fact that this parish was the original seat of the O'Donnells, might suggest the conjec-
ture, that it was introduced into the biography of the saint as an expedient of a later
age to add lustre to the chiefs of Tirconnell, by associating the history of their patron
with the origin of their race, were it not that there is evidence of avery early relation
between St. Columba’s family and the place, in the circumstance that the O’F1·ccls¹²‚
who were the ancient herenachs of the church lands there, were (10500οᾶοᾶ, not from
Dalachb‚the forefather of the O’Donnells, but from Eoghan‚ the brother of St. Columba.
The name Oill-mac—Nenain, deo, as explained above, indicates a like connexion.
