ZlIemoz'r of St. Adcznman. lxi

Of Adaman's two Latin works, the tract De Locis Sanetz's is the better written
and more flowing, but it bears a striking resemblance to the other in many parficulars
of style, and the use of peculiar words and phrases. In the following pages the reader
will observe the liberal employment of diminutivesey so characteristic of Irish composi-
tion; and he will find them, in many cases, used without any grammatical force, and
commutable, in the same chapters, with their primitives. The same tendeney is also
observable among verbs in the use of frequentatives and intensitivcs. He delights in
the distributive numerals instead of cardinals, and in the adjective terlnination aa·
where admissible. He uses the pluperfect for the perfect, and the nominative instead
of the ablative absolute. He occasionally employs Greek& οι· Greco-Latin words:
and in a few instances introduces Irish and Hibemo-Latin expressions& Proper
names‘ he sometimes inflects according to the rules of Irish grammar, so that in a
Latin narrat-ive they present an anomalous appearance. Above au, the artificial, and
often unnatural, interirem-ing of his words. in long sentences, and the oft-recurring
ablativo absolute in awkward position, will strike the reader as remarkable stature>-
of the style.

One subject more remains to be considered: the veneration of St. Adamnan’s me-

mory. In testimony of this, two classes of monuments exist, namely, the chnrehes ᾗ

under his patronage, and the appellations commemorative of his name.

Sc. Adamnan's Irish Churclces.

1. Ratkbotlz. He is the patron, but not the founderg, of this church, It was ori-
ginally monastic, and in the bestowal of conventual honours among the ancient Irish,
the distinctions of Orders were not regarded. Hence, when Raphoe became an episeo-
pal see, but under its old patronagc, after-ages, supposing that a bishop‘s sce must,
originate with a bishopb‚ took advantage of Adamnan's phonetic name Emeum, and
created a bishop Eumm patron of the diocese, moving his festival a fortnight back iu
the month, and leaving Adamana to cnjoy his old abbati-al honours on the 231¹d. Popc
Clement XII. approved of a mass for Bishop Eunan's festivals on the 7th of September.
