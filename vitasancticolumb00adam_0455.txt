the Pagan king, who resisted Patrick. In the St. Gall copy of Adamnan there is a
representation of St. Columba, but it gives 111111 the coronal tonsure, a mistakc into
which a continental manuscript of the njnth centiuy might- fall.

The sign of the cross was very generally employed as a sz‘qnzcm salutm-eu (12 5);
1101100 it was customary, before mist-jug, to eross the pail (1 26); before tools were used,
‘co cross them (143). The sign of 1110 cross was considered effectual to
banish demons (126, 127), to restrain a river-monster (141), to prostrate a mnes-aem
wfld beast (139), to unlock a door (151), to endow a pebble with heading
virtues (147). Hence the readiness to erect the substantial varmum crucis on thc site
of any remarkable occurrence (88, 231) ; a tendency which got full credit sor its deve-
lopment, when Hy was celebrated for her 360 crosses0. Even at sea, the cruciform
relation of the masts and yards was regarded us conduc-ive to a favourable voyage (1 78).
In the founder’s lifetime there was also an extensive employment of chunus, which
were produced by his blessing on such objeets as panis (109y 1 1 3), pinea capsella (1 1 2),

numeri (1 13),.ςαῖ (113, 1 14), aqua (109, 113), cuculla (136), 221191'0 (143), ..s-mles (154),

hence we may infer that the mayorum tonsura re-
ferred to above, had some influence on the Irish
style. In the Irish verses concerning the introduc-
tion of Christianity, ascribed to the native druids,
and which were ancient in the year 700¹ the term
by which the missionary is characterized is Cull-
een'o, which Muirchu, in the Book of Armagh,
renders Asciciput (fol. 2 bb), a word whose meaning
has not hitherto been explained. It is undoubtedly
a compound of Ast-ia, ⁸ an adze.' and caput. Simi-
larly, the Irish equivaleut is compounded of cul,
ascia, and cenn. caput. The Irish had a St. Mac-
tail (Jun. 11), whose name is interpreted filiu-⁹
meite, not, however, as is generally supposed, be-
cause his father was a carpenter (that would he
mue Gn epaon), but 011 the same principle that
Maecaile was filius veli.
lows Muirchu, not understanding the force of ascici-
ραι, and taking cml in the abstract sense of ars,
readers cculcent) artis caput, as if it denoted totius
artis maqister (cap. 26) Tr. Th. p. 49 α. The
Third Life in Colgan, caught by an apparent simi-
larity‚ substitute-s a ludicrous word, archia-aptis

‘ prime-capon* (cap. 30, Tr. Th. 23 b). The Second
and Fourth have vir cum corona decorata (Tr. Th.
pp. 14 α, 40 a). Jocelin renders it in circulo tonsus
in capite (cap. 31, Tr. Th. p. 7¹ b), and so in Tri-

part. Life (i. 43, Tr. Th. p. 123 b). Colgan‘s tonsus
in vertice (ib. p. 2 bb) is better. A passage iu ”
S. Brendan’s Life states that a mouk was struck
capiti securi, and that the place where he was buried
was called ⁴‘ Lebaydh in tollchymi, i. e. Lectus per—
forati capitis⁰ (Cod. Marsh. sol. 63 bb). If tailcenn
denote the coronal tonsure, it will be open to the
suspicion of having been coincd in the sex-emh cen-
tury, but if Iaeriyatum caput, it will suit any date.
