¹ Duire Calqaich.—The name is Latinized
Roboretum Calyachi in i. 2 (p. 19), 20 (p. 50),
supra. Calgach, the Galgacus ofTacitus (Agric.
c. 29), is a name occasionally found in the Irish
Annals (Four Mast. 5933 and in composition,
ibid. 622). It is derived from (3015, ‘a swor(l‚’
or ‘thorn ς’ and, as au adjective, denotes *sharp’
or *angryff Hence Ool5oeb‚ gen. Col5cnch‚
became a proper name in the sense of ‘fierce
warrior.v The foundation of the church of
Derry by St. Columba is thus recorded in the
Annals of Ulster, at 545: Daire Coluim cille
fundata est. There is, however, a prolepsis in
this name, for in every other instance where
the place is mentioned in the Annals, until the
middle of the tenth century, it is called by its
original designation, Daire Calyaich. The first
time that the form Daire Coluimcille occurs in
the Four Masters is at the year 950, about
which time it would seem that the memory of
the founder prevailed over the ancient name.
“ According to the early Irish Life, the church
ot* Derry was founded in consequence ofa grant
from King Aedh, son of Ainmire, and within
the royal precincts. Luro Cotum] ciue iopum

the royal fort of Aedh, son of Ainmire. who
was king of Erin at that time. The king of-
fered the fort to Columcille; but he refused it,
because of Mobi's command. On his coming
out of the fort, however, he met two of the
people of Mobi, bringing to him Mobi's girdle,
with his consent that Columcille should accept
a grant of territory, Mobi having died. Co-
lumcille then settled in the fort of Aedh, and
founded a church there, and wrought many
miracles in it! Now it is to be observed that
Mobi Clarainech, of Glas-naoidhen, now Glas-
nevin, near Dublin, died, according to the An-
nals of Ulster, in 544, the year preceding that
to which they assign the founding of Derry.
But Aedh. son of Ainmire, was slain, as
Tighernach states, in 598, in the 63rd year of
his age, so that he was born in 535, and there-
fore could have been only ten years old at the
date of the alleged grant. O'Donnell, who co-
pies this account, qualifies the statement con-
coming Aedh by observing: “Ejus tum loci
Princeps AiduS, filius Ainmrechi Regis Hiber-
niae; et ipse postea Rex. Dei suique cognati‚‘’
δια-ἱ. 48 (Tr. Th. p. 397 α). Α slight addi-
tion to the age of Aedh, as given by Tigher-
nach, would represent him sufficiently advanced
in years to become the patron of St. Columba;
but even this is unnecessary, if we regard him
at the age of ten as the representative of the
racc, and the donation made, as the Four
Masters state (though 535, the year they as-

,sigm be untenable)‚ ‘⁴ by his own tribe, i. e.

the racc of Conall Gulban, son of Nia11.’¹ The
