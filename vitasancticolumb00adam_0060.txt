ξ 1. Memoz'r <gf St. Adamnan.

DAMNANn, which is said to be a diminutivo of Adamh, is a name of unusual

form, and of rare occurrence in Irish records.

The Annals and Calendars pre-

sent but three or four instanecst of it, to Which the venei-able father of English history
adds anothcrd, aud then, taking the one best known at home, so treats of it as to make

it πολλῶν ἀντάξιος ἄλλων.

The individual whose celebrity was thus guaranteede was

born in Irelands, in or about the year 6243, and though there is no express record of

¹⁵ Adammzm-Adamnan's Life is given in the
Acta Sanctorum at Sept. 23 (tom⁴ vi. pp. 642-649),
from the pen of Constantinus Suyskeuus‚ but it
contains no new matter. The Irish Life, which is
preserved in one of the O'Clery MSS. at Brussels‚
furnished the legends on St. Adammm which ap-
pear in the Breviary of Aberdeen. It is a sort of
historieal discourse on J ob xxxviii. 3, intended for
the saint's festiva13 but it is a miserable productim,
full of absurdities aud anachronisms. Anything in
it worthy of notice wssl be found in this memoir.

1' Diminutive of Adam—See Cormac, cited at
p. 256, aud Baertius, at p. 142, infra.

s Three or fhur insinuem—The Calendars have
noue except our author. The Annals have, besides,
St. Adamnan, bishop and abbot of Rath-maighe-
aenaigh (An. Ult. 7303 Four Mast⁴ 725); and
Adomnan mac Alddailedh (An. Ult. 835). Ussher
mentions S. Adompnanus as the successor of St.
Cim-an in Inis-Aingin, now Hare mand, in Lough-
Ree in the Shannou (Wks. vi. p. 525)y and O’Conor
borrows from him (Rerum Hib. SS. vol. ii. p. 138,
n. 4z); but Ussher seems to have read the name
incorrectly, for in the Life of St. Ciuran, whence he

derived his information, the same individua] is called
“Quidam vir de Momonia sc. de gente Corcobais-
cind, nomine Donnanus.''—cap. 28 (Cod. Marsh.
fol. 147 aa). Marian Goruian setties the question:
Oonnuu pocupc 0 hup 01115111 pop Loch 1³15,
² Donnan⁷ priest, of Inis-Aingin on Loch Ribh'
(Cal. Jan. 7). The Adamnanus of Inchkethe
whom Fordun makes a contemporary of S. Serva-
nus (i. 6), is, by a violent anachronism, intended
for our Adamnan ς but Abp. Ussher was too desir-
ous to swell the history of North Britain, when on
such authority he represented Odomnanus as an
abbot anterior to St. Columba, and fixed his date at
the year 488 (Iud. Chron.).

d Another.—Adamnnnus of Coludi Urbs, or Col-
dingham, Beda, Hist. Ec. iv. 25. See Colgan, Act.
SS. p. 224, where Jan. 3¹ is given as his day, and
680 as the probable date of his death.
