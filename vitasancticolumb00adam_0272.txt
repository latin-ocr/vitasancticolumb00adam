only authority for rosetus, or roseta, which he
interpr-ets ¹* paxillus ferreus,'’ commonly called
the Ιίηι-Ιιφίη, or in Irish beolfynoieleom. But
it rather means a large nut οι· box fastened on
the end of the axle. The construction was af-
terwards changed, and the block wheel was in—
troduced, where the axle was firmly fixed in
the ulmels, and revolved with them. Cal-ts
thus made are still common in Ireland.

ε Columbanusfilius &huda-The connexion
os this Columbanus (or Culmanus, as the name
is more generally written, vid. note ὅ, p. 29,
supra) with the monastery mentioned in the
text, is noticed also in the Life of St. Fechin
os Fore: “Perrexit quodam die S. Fechinus
ad locum, qui Snamh-luthir dicitur, in regione
de Carbre gabhra. Et cum ibi offendisset Col-
manum filium Eoehadii a longo tempore oculis
captum, aquai, qua suas manus lavit, ad oculos
ejus admota, et aspersa, eum perfectissime
visus beneficio redonavith-cap 30 (Act. SS.
p* 136 b). St. Fechin died in 665, so that this
occurrence was of a much later date than that
in the text, at which time Colman was probably
a youth: at least his employment with St. Co·
lumba, and his condition when visited by St.
Fechin, indicate the opposite extremes of life.
lt may be observed here that St. Fechin is
stated in his Life to have had an interview
with Adamnan, and that the ancient author
declares he was informed of it by Adamnan
himself..-cap. 47 (Act. SS. p. ¹39 a). This

rated, Sept. 6, in Ros-glande, now Donaghmore
