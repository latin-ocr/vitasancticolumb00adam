Hy, by which we may understand, either that he was appointed, in consequence of the age or
infirmity of Conamhail, to administer the affairs of the society, as a tanist abbat, or that some
schism in the community, possibly ou the Paschal question (for Dunehadh proved a reformet in
7 16) led to a rival appointment. See O'Conor's note in Ber. Hib. Script. vol. iv. p. 72.

Son nfCennfaeladh. Called Duum-hadas by Bede (H. E. v, 22). He was of the most noble
branch of the house of Conall Gulban, for his grandfather Maelcobha. who died in 615, was the
third of the family who were successively monarche of Ireland, and his grand—uncle Domhnall,
who won the battle of Magh Rath (200) in ⁶37· succeeded Maelcobha ou the throne. During
his presidency there seems to have been a schism in the community, for in 713 and 716, two
other members of the order were elected to the cathedra Iae or Columbae .- or it may be that a
different office, such as prior, or even bishop, is denoted by the expression. On the death of
Conamail, he succeeded to the vacant abbacy. and it was not till 713 that Dorbene was
appointed to the chnir : who died in the same year. The next electiori to the chair was in 716,
und Faelcu, son of Dorbene, who was then chosen.¹ outlived him, and succeeded him in the full
enjnyment of the abbacy. It was under this abbot that the Columbian monks conformed to the
Roman Easter and Tonsure. The last occasion on which the old Easter was observed was at the
festival of 715, after a duration of 150 years (Bede, H. E. iii. 4). The change was effecte-d
through the exertions of a Northumbrian priest, called Ecgberct, ‘¹ qui in Hibernia diutius exul-
averat pro Christo, eratque et doctissimus in scripturis et longae vitae perfectione eximius” (ib).
The place of his abode had been “in monasterio quod lingua Scottorum Rathmelsiqih appella-
tur* (iii. 27). Having meditated a missiouary joumey to north Germany, he is said to have been
diverted from his purpose by avision, in which his former master Boisil appeared to him, and de-
clared that “ Dei voluntatis est ut ad Columbae monasteria magis pergat docenda'' (v. 9). Accord-
ingly. when upon the conformity of the Picts to the Roman observauce, one of the three remaining
obstacles to the unity was removed, an opportunity offered for the accomplishment of a work in
Hy, which Adamnan, a few years before, had attempted in vain. “Nec multo post illi quoque
