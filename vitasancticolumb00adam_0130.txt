'DE conMAco.

Amo quoque ²in tempore ³de Cormaco²³‚ ⁴nepote ⁴Lethanib‚ viro utique
sancto, ⁵qui tribus non minus vicibus eremum in oceano laboriose quaesivit, nec
tamen invenit, ⁶sanctus Columba ita ⁷prophetizans ait: Hodie iterum ⁸Corma-
cus, desertum reperire cupiens, enavigare incipit ab illa regione quae, ultra 9Μο-
dam⁰ fluvium msita, ²1Ein·0s Domno‘1 diuitum nec tamen etiam hac viee quod
quaerit inveniet; et non ob aliam ejus culpam nisi quod alicujus religiosi abbatis

charmel between Ballycastle and the island of
Rathlin is at certain times so disturbed by the
action of the tides, that even in the absence of
wind no small craft could live in it. It is lo-
cally known by the characteristic name Slus]-
namorra, that ἱε, Sto& nn mono, ‘ Gulp of the
sea,' and is probably the Jcildulzlaup, ¹ Breakiug
of waves,⁷ of the Icelandic sagas. To this ter-
ror of sailors <of which there was until lately
practical evidence in the extra pay received by
the coast-guard of the station), Giraldus Cam-
brensis refers in the grand, and but moderately
exaggerated, description : ¹‘ Non procul ab in-
sulis a parte boreali, est maris quaedam admi-
randa. vorayo : ad quam a remotis partibus
omnes undique marini fluctus tanquam ex con-
dicto confluunt, et concurrunt, qui in secreta
naturae penetralia se ibi transfundentes, quasi
in abyssum vorantur.'’ (Topogr. Hib. ii. 41.)
The earliest notice of the transfer of the name
is in Fordun, who, circ. 1390, writing of Scar-
bay, says, “juxta quam gurges oceani decurrit
fortissima, Corebrelcane nomine.'¹ (Scotichr. ii.
10.) lt is a curious fact that the only place in
Ireland where the name now exists is in the in-
land county of Monaghan, where a townland,
in the parisi] of Magheraeloone, having a fine
earthen fort, is called Corrybrackan. (Ord.

the guli* are preserved in Irish in the Dinn-
seanchus, and Cormac’s Glossary, the latter of
which, with other illustrative matter, is printed
in Reeves' “ Eccles. Antiqq. of Down and Con-
nor‚'¹ pp. 289, 386. See also the extract from
the Life of St. Kieran in Colgan (Tr. Th. p.
458 a); and O'Donnell’s Life of S. Columba,
iii. 21. (Ibid. p. 434 b.) For an account of the
natural phenomenon, see Hamilton’s Letters on
the N. Coast of Antrim‚ p. 14. (Dubl. ¹790·)

³ Comma—For his history see the notes on
ii. 42, iii. ¹7-

¹¹ Nepote Lemoni—'In Irish Uo bachum, a
elan name derived from his ancestor Eoehaidh
Liathanach‚ which afterwards assumed the
form Olechan, and was applied to a cantred in
the south-east of the couuty of Cork, anda
rural deanery in the diocese of Cloyne, conter-
minous with the civil district. See note on
title of ii. 42.

Ω Modum—The river Moy, called in lrish
illumne, rises in the county of Sligo, and be-
comeS, a little south of Ballina, the boundary
between the couuties of Sligo and Mayo, until
it falls into Killala Bay. Tirechan writes the
word Munda and Muaide (Liber Armacan.
fol. 14110, ¹5 aa); and Giraldus Cambrensis
