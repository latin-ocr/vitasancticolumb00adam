Adamnan tells of a puyio (143), and a mac-hera (ι 58), which were, probably, of

home manufacture. The process of fusing a piece of iron through the

Faber. ferramenta (143) of the establishment certainly indicates the existence of

workers in metal. With the 5050, or ‘ smith‚' was probably associated
the cepo, or ‘ brazier.’

The abbot had a private attendant called the minister (230, 2 31), and ministrator
(33), who waitcd on him, ministravit (55), was a nequent eompanion, and
an object of tendor solicitude (144).

Certa-in brcthren, active and expert semen, were employed as leqati (60, 1 1 1) on

particular occasions. These seem to have been speciauy charged with the

care of the boats and marine appointments.

Late in the history of the Columbian order comes under notice the society called

thldees¹. They had no particular connexion with this order any more

valedei. than had the Deoradbs or the other developments of convenma] observance.

The system, however, whatever its peculiarities may have been, was ad-

mitted in Hy, and the name osone Oen Cele—nDe, ‘ Superior of Culdees,’ like the
Prior Colideorum of Armagh, is recorded in the Annals of the order (Ult. 1164).

The original grant of Hy, whether Scottish or Pictish, or both, was soon extended

to the adjacent islands, as inszcloe Ethiea, Elena, Hinba, and the ifounder speaks of the

marim· nostrijuris rituli (78); and his successor forbids a stay in nostrie

Jurisilictfo. insulis (2 Ι). In spirituals the parent institution not only enjoyed a prin-

cipatus among all the monasteries of the order, both among the Scots and

Picts, but served as a capnt et ara· (341), exercising an extensive control over the people

at large-v. In successive ages this authority was gradually circumscribed. Much of

it was lost when Naiton, king of the Picts, expelled the Columbian clergy from his

dominions (184 n.) z and the forfeiture was completed among the Picts when diocesan

jiuisdiction became defined and established (297). Even among the Seots, the pres-

tige of Hy declined in proportion as rival influences grew (297) : remote endowments

“ were cut off (3 32); and the surviving rights in temporals aud spirituals were nar-
