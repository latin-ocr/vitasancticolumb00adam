Son of (longai, a descendant os Loarn, son of Fergus, son of conall Gulban. During his
presidency, Cillene, son of Congal, probably his brother, died at Hy; as also, at an advanced
age, Fedhlimidh, who became coadjutor abbot 111 722. At this period the Columbian influence
in Ireland seems to have been at its height, as may be concluded from the repeated mention of the
Lex Coluimcille (au. 7 5 3, 757), and the frequent visits of the abbot into Ireland. Suibhne, who
succeeded him, was coadjutor abbot in 766.

Chronicle we find the name 111 the form Athochlach,

¹ Cinriyhmonai. —Righ-monaidh or Reyrnonth
(Fordun, i. 6, ii. 60) was the old name of the pa-
rish of St. Andrew's 111 Fife, aud it is still preserved
in East and West Balrymonth, two high grounds
in its southern part. In the records of this church
Rymont is interpreted Reyius Mons, Mons Reyis.
(Pinkerton, Enq. vol. i. pp. 462, 499.) The Irish
Calendars call it eiu Ώῐδῐηοηωό, and assign St„
Cainnech to it, but Tighernach at 747, aud the
Four Mast. 742, call it, as above, clun-1115-

ῐηοῐιωὸ. The present entry supplies the earliest
authentic record of this monastery.

⁴* Bellum inter Pictos et Brittones, id est queith
Mocatauc, et rex eorum Talargan a Brittonibus oc-
ciditur” (Monument. p. 833). In the Brut y Tywys-
ogion it is called the battle of Maesydawc (ib. p.
842). The Irish cato represents the British name
divested of the prefix siguifying a plain.
