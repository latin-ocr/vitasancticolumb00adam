Wnnotr entering into the question of previous colonization², it is generally agreed
that about the year 506 a portion of the family of Eirc, son of Muinreamhar, part pos-
sessors of Dalriada, now known as the northern half of the county of Antrim, and the
senior representatives of Cairbre Righfada (92), called Reuda by Bedeb‚ and Riadav by
later writers, passed over with 0 considerable body of followers to the nearest part of
Argyleshire, where they permanently settled, and founded the kingdom of British
Scotia or Dalriada. The statement in Tighernaehd is, Fearqus Mor mac Earca cum
flente Dal-Riada partem Britannice tenuit, et ibi mortuus est. This F ergus is said in the
Tripartite Lifee of St. Patn'ck to have been the youngest son, and in the most ancient
reeords of the tribe does 001 appear as king until 1110 death of his elder brother Loarn.
The subsequent importanee of his family, however, made him the most remarkable
member of the colony, and he is put forward as the leader, because the sovereignty,
when once attained, existed in his family for nearly two hundred years. According 10
1110 Irish Traet on the Men of Alba, “ Three times fifty men were the emigrants that
went forth with the 50115 of Erc.'’ The eommeneement was comparatively weak, and
the territory occupied of very limitcd extent. From the fact, that after Loarn's death

thography is distinguished from that in the other
