MSS„ and soit was in the copy which Ussher
used3 but that which was employed by Colgan
and the Bollandists seems to have changed it
to Monamoire, in ordor to render it more con-
sormable to the Annals. We find a similar
compound, Inde-mor, at Four Mast. 4973 Tigh.
503. The following record of the battle is
found in Tighernaeh, immediately after the
mention of st. Columba's departure to Hy:
A. C. 563: ⁴‘ The battle of Moin-Daire-Lothaire
against the Cruithne by the Hy—Neill os the
North; in which seven kings of the Cruithne
were slain⁷ with Aedh Breac. Baedan son of
Coun, with two of the Cruithne, fought against
the Crnithne; and the Cinel Eoghain, and
[Cinel] Conaill [were those] they fought3 con-
ducti mercede [of] the Lee and Ard-Eolairg.”
Some verses of Cennsaeladh upon the battle are
then cited, from which we gather that the cause
os the battle was an unjust partition, and that
Eine, the territory between the Bann and the
Bush, was, on the occasion. wasted with fire.
The belligerants were the Cruithne or Dalara-
xlians, and the northern Hy Neill; the latter of
whom engaged in the strife at the instance of
a Cruithneau chief, who seems to have been
wronged by his own people,and who covenanted
to surrender to his auxiliaries the territory of
Lee and Ard Eolairg, ou the west side of the
Banu, which had been ceded to the Cruithne by
the Hy Neill, aster the battle of Ocha in 483.

From the mention of Lee and Elne, it is likely
that the scene ol the battle was not far from
the town of Coleraine. See the note on Muni-
tio Cethirni, cap. 49 infra.

‘¹ Conallo filio commin-He succeeded his
uncle Gabhran, in 560y and was followed on the
throne by his first cousin Aidan. The present
passage gives some support to the statement in
Tighernach that the grant of Hy was made by
him rather than the Piets: A. C. 574q horr

ν Ainmorius filius Setui.——Sedua the father
of Aiumire, and Fedblim St. Columba's father,
were brothers, being sons of Conall Gulban.
Ainmire helped to win the battle of Sligo in
543, and was one of Dermot‘s successful oppo-
nents at Cooldrevny. After the battle men-
tioned in the text, he was reinstated in the
possessions of his father Sedna. (Tighernach,
563.) These included the present barony of
Keenaght, in which Druim-Ceatt was situate,
and explain the cause why that district was
chosen for the convention which was held in
his son's reign. He became sovereign in 568,
aud reigned three years. Tir Ainmireclz, the
old name of the barony of Boylagh in the county
of Denegal, was derived from him. (O'Dono-
van, Four Mast. 1343.) We have his name in
the form Ainmuireq at iii. 5 infin.
