in Moylinny', and a devoted friend of the saint. He was an enterprising chief, and in
573 won the battle of Tola in the King‘s County. In 589 he became king of Uladh;
and in 594 won the battle of Edan-mor from the Ciannachta of Meath. In 597 he
won the battle of Sliabh Cua in &Vaterfonh and in 602 that of Cuil-caol in Down. In
623 he took Rath-Guala in madh ; and fell at the battle of Leth-Midhin in 626. Now,
supposing that he had taken part in the battle of Cul-rathajn before St. Columba's de-
parture, that is, the year 56 3, a period of 63 would have intervenetl between that and
his last achievement, a suspicions interval in a wanior's life. That the battle of Cul—
rathain, though not recorded in tho Annals, was fought,—that he was a leader therein,
—and that it took place in consequence of the jealousies of the Dalm-adiens and the
Hy Nem, quickened into action by the influcnce of their respective arch-ecclesiastiea
is extremely probable 2 only it was a militas-y event which fitllowed, not preceded, St.
Columba's settlement in Hy.

The third battle, that of Cul-fedha or Bealach-fedhaw, was fought in 587, and is
thus recorded by Tighernach :—

This battle, as well as that of Cul-Dremhne, was between the Northern and
Seuthem branches of the Hy Neill. It was fought by Aedh, son of Ainmire, to
avenge the death of Baedan, son of Ninnidh, monarch of Ireland, who had been slain
by Cumine, son of Colman Beg, and his second cousin Cumine, son of Libran, at Leim-
in-eieh, under the instigation of Colman Beg. How far St. Columba participated in
this transaction is not recorded, but that he was deeply interested in it appeffls evident
from the words of Tighernach, a sentiment which tho Four Masters studiously sup-
press. The relation which existed between the leaders in this battle, and between
them and St. Columba, will be 56611 at a glauce in the genealogica] table above.
