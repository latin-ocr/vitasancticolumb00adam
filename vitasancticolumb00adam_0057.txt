seripts, which bore on the history of St. Columba or his order3 and from this
valuable store he has drawn as freely as the limits of the work would
allow him.

In the department of topography the editor has been able to pronounce
with certainty upon many points which have hitherto been undetermined.
With two exceptione, every Irish name in Adamnan has been identified ; and
many Scotch 11311165, which hitherto were matter of conjecture, have been
traced to their true positions. Two journeys to the NVestern Isles afforded
to the editor advantages, not only of personal examination, but of an introduc-
tion to those whose local knowledge was a living reference in cases of difficulty.
It was thus that 116 has been enabled, in the ease of Iona, to add to his own
passing observation the constant experience of the Rev. Donald Mac Vean, 0116
of the ministers of that island, who has been at all times ready, in the most
obliging manner, to satisfy inquiry, and to whom the topographical account
of Hy in the present volume owes much of its accuracy and detail.
⁴ From Joseph Robertson, Esq„ of the Genera] Register House, Edinburgh,
the editor has received many valuable references and suggestions. To William
Skene, and John Stuart, Esqrs„ he is also under similar obligations.

That noble work, the Ore'yines parochiales Sentiat& formed a most valna-
ble precursor to the present undertaking, as the numerous references to it in
the following pages will show. Even in its incomplete state, it is an enduring
monument of unbounded patience and research. Will Ireland, with her ample
resources and able hands, never muster spirit sufficient for such a work ¹? But
first, national muniments must receive 501116 consideration, and she must ccase
to enjoy the unenviable distinction of possessing the least enred—for, worst-
kept records in Europe,

To the Rev. Dr. Todd, the Rev. Robert King, and ΜΓ. William Millar‚
who read the proofs of this work, the editor owes his grateful acknowledg-
ments for the patience with which they have performed their part, and the
valuable suggestions which they have made.
