made across the mouth of the little bay, bringing the level of the floor to an eleva-
tion of seventy or eighty feet over the sea. Over the sward in 11115 sequcstered spot
are the 011-011101 enclosures spoken of, the remains of some very early habitations.
There is no tradition of their use, but they remind one of the remark made in the Old
Stat. Aect. concerning the adjacent part of Mun z—-“ There are in the pal-ish many of
the round towers said to be Danish. They are set upon the sea-coast, and in sight of
one another'’ (xiv. p. 203). One of the 0110105 111 Ρο11 Laithrichean is thirty yards
in circumference, another thirteen.

3. Dzmhhnirq. This is the name of a well-defined, abrupt, rocky eminence in the
north-west of the island, on the top of which are the traces of a wall enclosing the
summity like the Celtic duns, and giving its designation to the whole.

4. Garadlc-Eachaz‘n 01⁵9, ‘Garden of young Hector,' said to take its name from
Hector M‘Lcan, one of the Duairt family. It is situate near the head of Port—a-Chur-
raich, where traces, said to 118 of 1115 1101158, are shown. There are the vestiges of 11111118-
rous little buildings in this valley, especially on the east side, near the stream which
runs down from Loch Staonaig. They appear to be very ancient.

ς. Teadz an¹ Epscoip, ‘ Bishop’s housc,' a small, ruinous building, sit-uate north east
of the Cathcdral. It. 15 mentioned by Pennant, and in the New Stat. Acct. (vii. pt. 2,
p. 333). In Sacheverell's time it was in good preservation.

6. The sites of the Mill and Bam, of which mention is made in Pennant (362) are
thus alluded to by a writer in 1843 : ‘¹ There is no lake of any consequence; but on a .
plain adj oining the gardens of the abbey, and surrounded by small hills, there are ves—
tiges of a large pieee of artificial water, which has consisted of several acres, and been
eontrived both for pleasure and utility. At the place where it has been dammed up,
and where there are the marks of a sluice, the ruins of a mill are still to be seen, Which
served the inhabitants for grinding their corn.’' Speaking of a cross (probably St.
J ohn's) which stood “ in a field upon the west side of the ehurch‚’' he observes :
“ There is a very ancient ruin of the granary about the same distance west firom it that
the chureh is distant from it to the east’' (N ew Stat. Acct. vii. pt. 2, pp. 317, 3 3 ς).

1. North of the CathcdraL and close to the Lochan Mor 011 1118 east, is a green 8111-
bankment, evidently very ancient, and apparently only a portion of the original design.
Pennant says :—“ North from the granary extends a narrow flat, with a double djke
ancl foss on one side, and a single dike on the other.” This bank, which is about
thirty-six feet wide inside, may have been intended to confine and deepen the waters
of the lake, or it may bc a portion of the vallum of the original monastery, for Pennant
says, “that the whole of their religious buildings were covered on the north side by
