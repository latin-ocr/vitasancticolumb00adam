Vita Sancti Columbae

[Lm. 111.

mian in Mabillon thus expresses·the fulfilment
of St. Columba's prediction: ⁴¹ Quod ita factum
est: mandatum namque viri Dei transgredi-
entes. regnum perdiderunt.” Colgan's text is
less explicit: “ Quod ita evenit mandatum viri
Dei transgredientibus.'' The expression rey-
num perdiderunt seems to refer to the departure
of the seeptre from the house of Gabhrau to
that of Loarn, which took place when Ferchar
Fada succeeded Maelduin. Chalmers fixes this
event at 681, while the Irish Annals record the
death of Maelduin at 689. In either case the
words appear to be interpolated, for Cummiau
died in 669. Adamnan, however, with propriety
uses the words iu the text, for he was thirteen
years old when the battle of Magh Rath was
fought, and he lived to see Ferchar Fada, of
the house of Loarn, several years on the throne.
During this period various reverses happened
to the house of Gabhran3 and not only did the
rival families ofthe race improve them to their
own advantage, but the Picts, Strathclyde
Britons, and Saxons were sure to profit by
their neighbours' declension. Tighernach re-

this battle was not Glenmorison, on Lech

O'Conor (vol. iv. p. 47) suggest, but a tract
in the debateable ground of W'est Lothian.

anciently Agned, and Dun Monaidh, but Cair-

other cases, and indicates the employment of a
different authority. There king Hoanis called
