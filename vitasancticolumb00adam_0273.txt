5 Snanz-Iulhirae-Stated in the passage cited
in last note froin St. Fechin's Life to have
been in Curbre Gabhra. To which may be
added the following, from the Life os St.
Ruadhan of Lorrha: ⁴¹ Quadam autem die cum
venisset Rodanus ad civitatem quae dicitur
Suum-Luthir, in regione Generis Karbri, in
eadem hora rex Generis Karbri mortuus sere-
batur in curru ad civitatem illam, totaque
plebs circa illurn valde lugens erat. Tunc
Rodanus illis misertus oravit Dominum. et
statim rex surrexit vivus, et obtulit civitatem
illam Snam-Luthir et gentem sibi adhaerentem
sancto Rodano.’' (Act. SS. April. ii. p. 383 a.)
Colgan thought that this Caii-bre Gabhra was
the same as Caii-bre of Drumcliffi now the ba-
rony of Carbury, in the county of Sligo, and
accordingly takes Suamh-luthir to that re-
mote part of Connaught, but, as might be ex-
pected, is unable to fix its position. (Tr. Th.
p. 384I1. n. 35; Act. SS. p.141 b, n. 18.) Col-
gan's authority led Archdall to place 811311111-
luthir iu the county of Sligo: and, as a conse-
quence, to confess ¹· we know nothing further

of this abbey.'' (Monast. p. 639.) But Dr.
O'Donovan was not to be so easily misled, for
he shows that Caii-bre Gabhra is represented
by the modern barony of Granard. in the N. E.
of the county of Longford. (Four Mast. 731.)
That the territory, however, extended much
further northwards, and included a considera-
ble portion of Loughtee Upper, in the county
of Cavan, will appear from the identification os
