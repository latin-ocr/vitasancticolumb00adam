The history of the manuscript is interesting. It was undoubtedly written
in the west3 and was probably taken to Germany in the early part of the
niuth century. The corrections of the Irish orthography, and the peculiar
hand of the corrector, indicate a foreign revision, aud at the period mentioned.
The monastery of Augia Dives, or Reichenau‘, where the book was found at
the beginning of the seventecnth century, was an ancient monastery much fre-
quented by the hish, and its abbot, from 842 to 849, was the celebrated
lValafridus Sti-abus, who had been previously Dean of St. Gall, another monss
astcry of Irish connexion. At the beginning of the ninth century a strong
tide of Irish pilgrinis set in towards Grermanyu 3 possibly caused by the Norse
invasions of the west ; and it is likely that the breaking up of Hy, at the same
time, and by the same influenee, caused many members of the Columbian
society to fall in with the movement. There undoubtedly was some such
communieation between Ireland and eastern Germany soon after 825, whereby
XValafridus Sti-abus, who records the martyrdom of St.Blaithmac‚ was made

acquainted with the particulars of that tragical event& St. Fintan, the patron

the conventual ehurch, a structure of extreme
age, was lately whitewashed, and deprived ofits

‘Vecroloyium of Reichenau was published by
Keller some years since, and the Liber Con-

of which contains the names of strangers

eighth to the twelfth centuries, including Ice-
landers, is reported to be still in existence.
The valuable relies of the library were carried
away by the monks at the suppression in 1799,
to prevent their falling into the hands of the
Government (Baden).

strabus, in his Life of St. Gall, is very much to
the purpose: “Nuper quoque de natione Sco—
