of Pergus mac Erc, it adds, “ Quae prophetia.
postea completa est in AEdano filio Gabhrani,
ex ejus semine procedente, qui manu violenta
regnum Albaniae occupavit.”—ii. 135 (Tr. Th.
p. ¹47 b). To the same effect Jocelin also,

²¹ AEquoreos.—Derry was a point of commu-
nication with Hy, see i. 2, ii. 39; O’Donnell,
iii. 21. In coming to Druimceatt, St. Columba
entered the mouth of Lough Foyle (O'Don. iii.
3, Tr. Th. 43¹ a) 3 but in proceeding to Scot-
land on this occasion, he embarked at Coleraine.
In his first voyage he followed the northern
coast from Derry to the mouth of the Baun,
and thence across.—O’Don. ii. 10 (Tr. Th.
p. 4¹0 b).

Ε Comyellus.—Founder and first abbot ofBan-
gor in the Ards of [Πειρη born in 517, died in
602. The introduction of his name here is very
natural, as the church of Cambas, which is men-
tioned a little further on, was founded by him,
and is situate in the next parish to that where
this interview took place¹ being distant about
four miles east of Dun-Celiern, or the Sconce.
Concerning his parentage, see the following
note on Crathinipopuli, aud that on his name in
iii. 17, infra. On his chief monastery see the
note iii. 13, infra.

f Supra memorata mammona—This refers to
the name in the titulus, the omission of which
by the Bollandists leaves their text in this
place imperfect. The same observation applies
to the text of the shorter recension represented
by Codd. C. D. F. S„ which exhibits the words
supra memorata, but has no antecedent mention
of the name; prox-ing that there has been an
omission, and that consequently the text in
that family of MSS. is au abridged one. See
note b, p. 66, and note ³, p. 76, supra.

g NeIlis Nepotes.-That is. Ui Nestl, com-
monly called Hy-Neill, or the descendants of
Niall of the Niue Hostages. The sons of this
monareh by his first wife were Laeghaire, St.
Patriek's contemporary, and Conall Crimthaun,
grandfather of Dermait Mac Cerbhail, men-
tioned above in cap. 36. whose descendants oc-
cupied Meath, and were, from their position,
styled the southern Hy Neill. By his second
wife he had Eoghan, aucestor of the Cenel
Eoghain, who gave name to Tyrone and [111511-
owen. and were in after times represented by
the O'Neill family3 Conall Gulban, aucestor of
the Cinel Conaill, who gave name to Tir-Con-
nell, now Donegal; Cairbre, Enna, and others of
inferior note, collectively forming the Northern
Hy Neill. St. Columba was great-grandson of
Couall Gulban, and first-cousin of Ainmire, the
