period long anterior to St. Columba’s birth. The oldest tombstones in the cemetery

buried the Scotch kings down to Malcolm Ceann-rnore; here Ecgfrid, the North-
umbrian king, was buried in 684 (187); hither were removed the remains of king
Godred in 1188 (chron. Mam), and of Haeo Ospac in 1228 (ib). Of these kings

no monuments remain, and the chief part of the interesting tombstones that are found ἱ

there belong to the Clanns Finnguine, Gilla-Eoin, and Grmirc, since known as 1110

dral. To this Mart-in refers where he says:——“ There is an empty piece of ground
between the Church and the Gardens, in which Murderers and children that died
before Baptism were buried'’ (p. 258). Speaking of the same green bank, Pennant
saysz—“At the end is a square containing a caim, and surrounded with a stone dyke.
This is called a burial-place: it must have been in very early times cotemporary with
other cairus, perhaps in the days of Druz'elism. For Bishop Poeock mentions that he
has seen two 5101105, 7 feet high, with a third laid across on their tops, an evident
