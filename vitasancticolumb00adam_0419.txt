The date of Gregory the Grcat’s accession is Sept. 3, 590, within seven years of which
this alleged occurrence may bc supposed to have taken place. In O‘Donnell the cirv
cumstances of the gift are told more 111 detail, and he ends the account hy saying that
the reliquary was preserved, at the time when he wrote (1 ς 32), in the island of Tory:
“ Estque illud celebre monumentum quod in Torachiai occidua Hiberniae insula in me-
moriam Columbae asservatum Crux magna vulgo appellatur’'¹⁵. This altar cross is not
now known to exist, but from the description it would seem that it was cased ’111 11101111,
and adorned with crystal bosses, like the cross of Cong preserved in the Museum ofthe
Royal Irish Aeademy.

2. Tm: Carmen—This name, which is interpretcd Proelc'ator¹‚ is derived from
00011, ‘ battle,’ for the reason given by O’Donnell in the passage cited at p. 249, supra.
It is questionablc whether the writing of the manuscript be as old as St. Columba's
age, though its claim to be considered in the handwriting of St. Columba derives some
weight from the great veneration in which it was formerly held, notwithstanding 1110
total absence of decoration. It is a curious particular in its contents, that the reading
of Psal. xxxiii. 11, differs from that which is cited by Adamnan as the subject of St.
Columba's last act of penmanshjpm. Of the silver case, Which is 11011· its most attractive
feature, it is unnecessary to offer any description here, as a detailed account, with

The inscription, however, which runs along three sides of 1110 margin of the under
