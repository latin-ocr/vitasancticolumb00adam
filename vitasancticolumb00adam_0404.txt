nan 01· Eigg. The pedigree of the last is not on record, and au that we know concern-
ing him is what may be gathered from short notiees in the Irish Calendars and Annals.
His name, indeed, occurs at its proper day in the Calendar and Offiees of the Breviary
of Aberdeen, but there is no allusion to his history, and therefore the writer of his
momoir in the Aeta Sanctorum is obliged to draw entirer upon Irish authorities. We
ure told this much of him—that, like St. Columba, St. Maeh'ubha, and St. Moluoe,
this saint was a. native of Ireland, and was led to settle, with a company of followers,
in the west of Scotland, and that he suffered a violent death at the instance of a mali-
cious woman, and by the hands of a marauding party, possibly of Pictsc from the
neighbouring coast. We leam that he was somewhat junior to St. Columba, whose
friend ho was, and in whose communjty he desired to be enrolled. He suffered mar-
tyrdom on Sunday, the 17th of April, 617.

His eonunemoration in the Feilire of AEngus, and the aeeompanying eommentary,

are as follows :—

Picta-..The Life of St.00n1ga11 relates that
while he abode iu the Reyio Hetlz, that is, Tiree,
about the year 565, “gentiles latrunculi multi de
Piotonibus irruerunt in villam illam, ut raperent
omnia quae ibi erant, sive homines, sive pecora.”—-
αφ. 22 (Fleining, Collectan. p. 307 b). It would
appear from this that the Picts‚ in their piratica]
character, still hovered about the W'estern Islands.
