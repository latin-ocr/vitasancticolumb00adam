the same principle may be attributed the custom which was common to St. Benedict
and St. Comgall, and which probably extended to St. columba, as a received observanee
of the time : “ Si quis stater pro quavis minima causa, ab abbate 101 3 quocunque priore
suo corripiat-ur, 51110 mora tandiu prostratus in terra ante pedes ejus jaceat satisfaciens
usque dum benedictione sanetur 1113 eommotio⁷‘⁰. St. Comgall’s Life says: “ Mos erat
111 monasterio saneti patris Comgalli, ut si quis alium increparet, quamvis 1110 esset
culpabilis aut inculpabilis, statim qui increpabatur genua humiliter flectcrct’'', The
strict observancc of thjs regulation is exemph'fied by legends showing the extraordinary
lengths to which compliance with the letter of the precept was carried.

Hospitality, so leading a feature 111 ancient monasticism, was developed 111 Hy 111
the fulness of 1131101131 generosity : hence, a large portion of Adamnan’s aneedotes have
reference to the entertainment of strangers3 and the story of the heron
(91) serves 35 3 lively illustration ot¹ the kind reception which was always Hospitalitas
111 store for the visitor. When a strangcr arrived, he was sometimes intro—
duced at once to the abbot, by whom hc was kissed (54, 61) ; sometimes the interview
was deferred (20, 157). When 311 expected guest arrived, the abbot and brethren went
to meet and welcomc him (28, 59, 87). Hc was conducted to the oratoryg (24, 152,
168), and thanks 10111111οἀ for his safety. From this he was led to a lodging, hospitium
(61 ), and water prepared to wash his feeth (27). If the visitor happened to 311110 011
311 ordinary fast-day of the week, the fast was relaxedi in his fai-our (55), consolatio
cibi (5ο) was allowed, and 110 was 531(1 jzjmmtl'onem solvere (5 5). Ahnsgiving was held
in high esteem (132), and the founder, on several occasions, befriended the poor (130,
154). An instance is recorded where valuable present-s, under the name of xenia (79),
were sent to a man 111 110οᾱ (78). Itinerant beggars, who went about with wallets
(13 1 )‚ were not held in such esteem. The monastery was resorted to for medical relies
also ( 5 5), Grievous transgressors were excluded (51).
