lxxii Appendix to Preface.

The youth Columba, when arrived at sufficient age, left the scene of his fosteragee,
and, travelling southwards‚ came to Movilled, at the head of Strangford Lough, where
he became a pupil of the famous bishop, St. Finm’ane. Here he was ordained deaeon;
and to the period of his sojourn in this monastery is resemble the aneedote which is
told by Adamnan in the opening chapter of the second books.

From Moville, St. Columba prooeeded further southwards, and, arriw'ng in Leinster,
placed himself under the instruction of an agcd bard called Gemman. At this stage of
the saint’s life, he being still a deaeon, occurred an incident which Adamnan records
in the course of his nan—ativess. ⁷

Lem-ing Gemman, he entered the monastic seminary of Clonard, over which St.
Finnian the founder then presided. Here St. Columba is said to hare been numbered
with a class of students who afterwards attained great celebrity as fathers of the Irish
Churchh. St. Finnian does not appear to have been a bishop³, and when Columba was
subsequently judged worthy of admission to superior orders, he was sent to Etohenj,

the bishop of Clonfadk, by whom he was ordainod a priesffl.
According to the Irish memoirs, St. Columba left st. Finnian, and entered the mon-
astery of Mobhi Claraineehm, whose establishment at Glas Naoidhen, now Glasnevin,

¹ Priest.—The legend says that St. columba
went to receive episcopal orders from Etchen, but
that, through a mistake of the bisbop, priest‘s orders
only were conferi-ed. The whole story seems a fic-
tion osa later age. It supposesy among other anom-
alies, ordination per saltum, and the degree of order
to depend on the volition of the officiating minister.
