as a fit opportunity occurred, and have been on
that account often praised by Bede. lt can
scarcely be doubted, that they were the instru-
ments used by the Almighty sor the couversion
of those early Anglo-Saxon Christians in Co-
lumba¹s time; and that, with regard to a part
os that nation, they got the start of the Roman
missionaries iu the blessed work of bringing
them over to the Christian saith.”—Lanigan‚

¹¹ Piston—The corrupt reading pictor in Col—
gan and the Bollandists has been productive
of opposite results. On the one hand, it has
afforded to the admirers os ancient Irish art a
supposed evidence of its cultivation in Hy (see
Dr. F. Keller’s Bilder und Schriftziiye in den
irischen Manusm-ipeen, p. 73, where westwood’s

would have excused other Canidios, sor Cani-

error in Colgan and the Acta Sanctorum arose
from the use of a common manuscript, Stephen
White's transcript of Cod. A.‚ which probably
contained the incorr-eet reading. Colgan’s
abridged version of O’Donnell has pictor, ii. 26

ventured on au imagined emendation.
