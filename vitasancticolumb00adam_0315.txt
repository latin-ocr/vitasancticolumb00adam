⁴¹ Airchart-dan.—Now Glen Urquhart7 on the
west side of Loch Ness. Glen-aroclaedan is the
local pronunciation of the name. lt is said
that at Templehouse, in the entrance of the
glen, there was formerly a church, at a spot
marked by a large asli—tree, and that the ce-
metery occupied the space now crossed by the
road. There are the remains of other ancient
cemeteries in the glen, called Killmeechal, Kil-
lyeenan, and Croch-an-boora. This Urquhart
is not to be confounded with the Urquhard
mentioned in St. Malrubius’ lections in the Bre-
viary of Aberdeen (Part. Estiv. fol. 90 α b) ;
the latter is the same as Ferintosh in the Black
lsle in Rosshire‚ where St. Maree's memory is
still preserved.

ε Emclmtus.-Probab1y the same as the Irish
name linehssbh.

⁸ Monasterii rotundi.—Dr. Petrie supposes,
with some reason, that the building here re-
ferred to was an ecclesiastical Round Tower‚
and observes: “We have, at least⁷ one histo-
rical authority which, to my mind, satisfactorily

proves the erectiori of a Round Tower in the
sixth century.''(Round Towers, p. 38 z.) See the
note on Asaynae domus, next page. The learned
writer, however, makes some mistakes regard-
ing the copies of Adamnan. lf he had ever
seen Cod. B.‚ the exemplar which Pinkerton
professes to follow, he would not have called it
“ahls. of the twelfth century :''j1{fceenllt is more
likely to be the date. Speaking of the printed
editions, he observes, “that the important head—
ing prefixed to this chapter is not found in that
of the Bollandists; but it is found in the better
edition of Colgan, which is taken from an an-
cient vellum manuscript, preserved at Angla
(Aux), in Germany.'' (lb. p. 383.) The Bol-
landist editor hus printed it at p. 227 h, num.15‚
only not in situ. Colgan and the Bollandists
followed the same exemplar, and employed the
same transcript. of it, namely, that made by
Stephen White: and, consequently‚ their errors
and omissions proceed pari passu, except where
either ventures to emend on his own indivi-
dual authority. Their exemplar is our Cod. A..
