lumba is in Hy, where hjs remains were suffered to lie till a century had passed.
Meanwhile his dust had mingled with the earth, and dust with (lust continues there to
this day: but where that grave is, there is no satisfactory evidence to show; and tra-
dition, which claiins for the island the eustody of the body, fails, as might be expected,
to point out the spot where it lies‘. It was the custom in the eighth eentmy, particularly
in the Irish Church, to disinter and enshrine the tangible remains of the founders of
religious houses. There are explicit reeords of the very years when such proeesses
took placey ; and that St. Columba’s remains were dealt with in like manner, is a priori
to be expected, and in fact proved. The shrine in which these bones were deposited
subsequently became the title-deed of the Columbian eommunity, and was from time
to time taken over to Ireland as the warrant for levying religious cont1·ibutions¹. But
it soon became exposed ‘to fresh danger : for the eostliness of the shrine, which vene-
ration for the founder’s memory had suggested, exeited the cupidity of the rom'ng
N orthmen; and Ireland became the permanent asylum of these reliques, until it in
turn suffered from the same scourge, and even its midland remoteness proved no seeu-
rity against the restless Dauos. It is possible that, during these constant removals of
the shrine, portioris of the reliques may have been taken out, and under the compul-
sion of power, or the inducements of patronage, have been shared with other churches 3

¹ It lies.—Martiu says: ¹· Near to the west
eud of the Church in a little Cell lies Columbus his
Tomb‚ but without Inscriptiou ς this gave me occa-
sion to cite the Distich, asserting that Columbus
was buried in Ireland; at which the Natives of
Iona seem'd very much displeas’d, and affirm'd that
theJrish who said so were impudent Liars3 that
columbus was once buried in this Place, and that
noue ever came from Ireland to carry away his
Coms, which, had they attempted, would have
prov'd equally vain and presumptuous.''—Western
ο Islands, p. 258. The place Martin refers to is the
cavity near Martin's Cross, opposite the west door
of the cathedral. But this ground does not appear
to have been a cemetery, or, at all events, not to have
been an original one. St. Columba's grave should
be sought for in the Reilig Odhrain.
