an exception to the rule (5 ς). Lent was strictly kept as a preparation for
Easter (158), and during this season the fast was prolonged every day except Sunday

Holy Orders were eonferred by a bishop only. Young men were admitted to the
Diaconate while students (137), and part of their duty was to wait upon the ministers
