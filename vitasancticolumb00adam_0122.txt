who were abbots of Cluaiueidhneaea or Clo-
uenagh, in Queen‘s County. (Colgan, Act. SS.
p. 336 a.) The pai-ish of Taghmon in West-
meath likewisc derives its name from him. His
principal church in Seotland was Kilmond, now
Kilmun iu CowaH, to which the Breviary of
Aberdeen assigns his burial (Propr. SS. Part.
Estiv. fol. 132 aa); where local tradition even
marks the supposed place os his sepulture by
the name of δίιῘι-Μιιιι (Old Stat. Survey‚ vol.
ii, p. 383); and where a half-markland was
held in virtue of the custody of his crosier.
(lanes, Orig. Paroch. vol. ii. pt. i. p. 72.) The
old parish of Elanmunde, on the confines of
Argyle and Inverness, derived its name from
an island in Loch Leven, on which there was a
vhurch called after S. Mund. (Ibid. p. 170.)
