Ob. April 3.

Son of Dorbene, of the rane of Conall Gulban, but in 3 different line from the preceding
31111015, namely, through 1115 5011 Nathi. He was born in 642, for he was 74 years 0111 when he
was elected to the cathedra Columbe in 716, and he was 82 years of nge when he died. Under
him, according to Tighernach, the society of Hy received the coronal tonsure. There is some
uncertainty about his festival: Colgan places it at April 3, but the name does not appear in the

Calendars at that day. They have Faolehu, without any piace, at May 2 3, and J uly 20. It
was probably soon aster his accession 11131 the Columbian congregation was driven by king
Nechmn beyond the Pictish froutier. They were, 110 doubt, reluctant to acquiesce in the royal
edict, “Hoc observare tempus paschoe cum universa 11103 geute perpetuo volo; hanc accipere

debere tonsuram quam plenam esse rationis audimus, omnes qui in 11100 regno sunt clericus
decern0.''—-(Bede‚ H. E. v. 21.) See note ἓ, p. 184, supra.
