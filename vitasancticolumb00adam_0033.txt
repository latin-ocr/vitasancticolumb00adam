As regards the writing, there are three hands discernible3 the first that of
the substance os the manuscript, which is very unfform, and never departs
from the steady boldness of the letter, except where a new pen produces an in-
crease of sharpness and smoothness of stroke. A second hand, possibly from
the same writer, but with a different ink and pen, and in a smaller, rounder
letter, appears on p. 108 a, beginning at the words Cammeneus Albus z'n libros,
&Q in iii. 5 (199), to the end of the chapter. The third hand is the later and
inferior one which has made the corrections in the orthography in different
places. As regards ornament, capital& some of them of considerable size,
are liberally used: the books open with very large letters, and the initials of
the Chapters are proportionably distinguished. In every column, where a new
clause commences, the first letter is daubed with red or yellow paint. There
is a total absence, however, of interlaeing or artistic work, and the capitals are
illuminated by the simple process of dotting the substance of the stroke with
yellow, or its margins with red, and filling up the hollow with red or yellow.
The capitulationes at the commencement, the tituli of the chapters, and the
colophon of the scribe, are all written in rubric, which is in general very fresh
and beautifulh. Over the signs of abbreviation, also, there is commonly added a
similar stroke in red. The ordinary ink is generally very dax-ki, but it varies,
in some places being as black as jet, in other places turned brownk. The book
itself is in quarto, and consists of 68 leaves, each measuring 103 by 8} inches.

τ Proper names.——The same system of accent-
uation exists in the Latin tracts at the begin-
ning of the Book of Armagh, except that the
accents are more numerous, sometimes accom-
panying every letter in a proper name⁷ some-
times only the vowels. By this means the
proper nameS. in the absence of eapitaIS‚ can
be discet-ned at a glauce.

'Both—Dr. Keller's observation on this
subject is very just: ⁶* In den alteru irischen
Msc. ist eine dicke Tinte benutzt worden, die
sich durch ihre Sehwiirze und Dauerhaftigkeit
in hohem Grade auszeichnet. Sie wider-steht
