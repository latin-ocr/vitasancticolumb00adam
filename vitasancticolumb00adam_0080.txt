have solved that difficulty; and if he had gone further, he might have found the
Bollandist's remarks³ upon the expression. Lastly, as to the Apology, the res is of
course different from the narrative of the Vita, while the stylus (te sermo are so similar
to the rest, that none save the architect of a paradox could disccrn the difference in
the materials. The Life, where there is a slight variation of style, tells its own story,
for it professes to be compilation ; and we might as well deny the genuineness of Bede's
Ecclesiastical History, because an early chapter is borrowed from Gildas, and another
from Constantius, without acknowledgment. There is interna] evidence in the Life on
the following points to satisfy any but a theofist, that, 1, It was written by an eccle-
siastic, hving in Ioua insula (pp. 176, 181), styled nostra (pp. 12, 178), in which was
vostrum mona-steriwn (pp. 58, 72, 177); z, By the superior of the monastery (pp. 16,
26, 22 3 tz't.); whose immediate predecessor was Falbeus, and he a successor of δορί-
neu-s (pp. 16, 26); 3, By one who conversed with those who had heard S. Columba’s
voice (p. 7 3); who convcrsed with a person who remembered the night on which S.
Columba died (p. 2 38) ; who convelsed with the acquaintances of St. Columba's
friends (pp. 50, 85, 237); who oonversed with a person who had witnessed the battle
of Dun-Ceithirn in 629 (p. 9 5) ; who knew an carly friend of the St. Fintan who died in
63 5 (p. 22); who conversed with the nephew of his predecessor Virgnous who died
in 62 3 (p. 225); who was living when the battle of Hugh-Rath took place (p. 200);
who witnessed the ravages of the Great Pestilence (p. 182); who was a persona]
friend of King Aldfiid (p. 18 5); who lived when the House of Gabhran was declining
(p. 201); 4, By one whose name uras Admmmn (pp. 16, 95, 225, 238). Here is an
accumulation of evidence which should satisfy any mind, and the more so as it is
for the most part undesigned and ineidental, the internal counterpart of the writer’s
own declaration: “Hujus ergo praemissae narrationis testes, non bini tantum vel
terni, secundum legem, sed centeni et amplius adhuc exstant'’ (pp. 17, 182).

Besides these Latin works, Adamnan is said to have written, 1, Α Life of St.
Patrc'ck. This is stated twice in the Tripaltite Lifcb. z, Poems. Tighernach cites
some verses of his, at the year 695, and the Four Masters, at 742. His alleged Feilire, or
‘ Fest010g5,‘ consisting of seven quatrains and a half, comes also under this head. The
poem ο11 the remission of the Boromean tribute, containing fifty-two stanzas, though
bearing his name, is hardly compatible with his religious character, and evidences the
genius rather than the picty of the writer. 3, ffi'storz'a Hiber-norum ab orfiqt'ne ad sua
tempora, mentioned by Wardc, but otherwise unknown. 4, Epitome metrica triqz'nta
voluminum legum Hiberm'eammz, also mentioned by Ward; and, like the preceding
article, probably some compilation of modern date and no authority.
