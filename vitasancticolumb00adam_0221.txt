²³ Cainm'cl1i.-This famous saint, of whom
frequent mention is made by Adamnan, was
born in 517, and died in 600. He was a native
of Keenaght, in the couuty of Londonderry, in
which barony his principal northern church,
called Drumachose, was situated, where for
many centuries his memory was specially vene-
rated,and the superior of which was styled ⁴ the
Coarb of Cainnech in Cinnacht.¹ See Reeves‘
Colton's Visit. pp. 25, 39, 132³ Eccles. Ant. p.
374. For his descent see the note on Cainne-
chus Mocu Dalon, iii. 17, iufra. His principal
churches in the south were Aghaboe, on which
see next note, and the two KilkennyS, on which
see note b, i. 4 (p. 28) supra. ln Scotland he is
generally called Kenneth; and Kilkenneth, or
Kilebenzie, is a common name of churches in
Argyleshire and the Western Islands. Hjs fes-
tival. both in Ireland and Scotland, is October
11. There are six lessons at his festival in the
Breviary of Aberdeen, intituled, “Sancti cay-
nici abbatis qui in Kennoquhy in diocesi sancti
andree pro patrono habetur.'' The church
here mentioned is Kcunoway in Fife.

ι’ Aclzed-bou.—Now Aghaboe, a parish in the
Queen's County, and diocese of Ossory. The
site aud lande of the monastery were granted
to St. Cainnech by his patron, Colman, son of
Feradach, King of Ossory. See note ὃ, i. 11

Aghaboe subsequently became the episcopal
seat os Ossory: “Anno Domini meu. [recte

episcopus Ossoriensis; cujus ecclesia cathe-
dralis tunc erat apud Aghboo in superiori

vi.p.526). Before ¹²50 the cathedral was trans-
ferred to Kilkenny [Ciu Cuinni5h, ‘Cainnech's
church‘], where was an ancient religious esta-
blishment, of which the Round Tower still
remains an evidence. See Harris' WVare's
Works, vol. i. pp. 399, 403, 406; Archdall's
Monasticon Hib. p. 538. In the Taxations
contained in the Red Book of Ossory, Aghabue
is the head of a RuralDeanery0'01. 21, 24).
Α very interesting memoir of Aghaboe, com-
piled about 1793, by Dr. Edward Lcdwich, then
incumbent of the parish, appears in Masou's
Parochial Survey of Ireland (vol. i. pp. 13—78);
in which work it is stated that repvints ofLed-
wich's account ot* Aghaboe, and Sir John Sin-
clair's account of Thurso (Old Stat. Surv. of
Scotland, vol. xx. p. 493), were circulated
among the cler-gy of Ireland as models sor their
contributions toan Irish Parochial Survey. (p.
xii.) On the orthography of the name, see
