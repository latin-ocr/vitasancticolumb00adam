The word is not found in Bede's Hist. Eccl.;
it occurs once in his Hist. Abb. Uuirem„ where
the abbot of Jarrow describes himself as an
ecelesiastical office bearer in Samum-c. 14
(p. 329, ed. Hussey). The Four Masters use
Saxa, and its inflexions, for Saxones.

¹Aldsridum.—Oswy, King of Norfflumbria,
died in 670, and was suceeeded by his son Eg-
frid. Aldfrid, though an elder brother, was
superseded on the ground of illegitimacy.
WVhereupon, it is related, “in Hiberniam, seu
vi seu indignatione, secesserat. lbi, ct ab
odio germani tutus, et magno otio literis im-
butus, omni philosophia composuerat animum.
Quocirca, imperii habenis, habiliorem aestiman-
tes, qui quondam expulerant ultro expetive-
ruut.''--Wilhelmi Malmcsbin, Gest. Reg. 52
(ed. Thomas D. Hardy, 1840). Bede states that
when Elfleda applied to St. Cuthbert for infor-
mation about her brother Egsrid‘s successor on
the throne, his answer was: “Cernis hoc mare
magnum et spatiosum, quot abundet insulis?
Facile est Deo dc aliqua harum sibi providere
quem regno praeficiat Aug-lorum. Intellexitcrgo
quia de Aldfrido, qui ferebatur filius fuisse pa-
tris illius, et tunc in insulis Scotorum ob stu-
dium litterarum exulabat.'' And adds, “ngri-
dus post annum Pictorum gladio trucidatur, et
Alfridus in regnum frater ejus nothus substi—
mitur, qui non paucis ante temporibus in re-
gionibus Scotorum lectioni operam dabat, ibi
ob amorem sapientiae, spontaneum passus exi—
lium.”—Vit. S. Cuthberti, c. 24 (Colg. Act.. SS.
p. 668.) Scin the Legenda Aurea (lb. p. 683 ᾳ).
Thus three reasons are assigned for his retire-
‘ment to Ireland. Irish writers add two tnorc:
they state that his mother was anative ofthat

country, and observe: ‘¹ Non sui tantum literis
excolendi causain Hiberniam venit, verum etiam
ut sanctis Hiberniae deprecantibus limace qui
in aurem ejus irrepsit, et eapitis humoribus at-
tractis intumuit educto, molestia, et morbo ex
ea re contracta immunis efficeretur.'¹ (Lynch,
Cambr. Evers. p. 128 ; or vol. ii. p. 236, repriut.)
His descent by his mothcr's side is stated by
AEngus, a writer of the eighth century, to have
been from the princely house ofNiall: pinu

¹ Fina, daughter of Cennsaeladh, was mother of
Flann Fina, son of Ossa. Aliter, Fina, daugh-
ter of Colman Rimidh, son of Baedan, son of
Muircertach, son of Muircdhach, was mother
of Flann Fina, king of the Saxeus: (Tract-
de Matr. SS. Hib„ Liber Lecan., ful. 43; Η.
2. 16, Trin. Coll. Dubl. p. 365.) In the Clann
Neill gcnealogy (Lib. Lecan. sol. 63), Fina is
represented as great-granddaughter of Muir-
cessach, either through his son Baedan. or
Ailill, father of Cennfaeladh. Under the name
Flami Fina Aldfrid was familiarly known by
the Irish. Thus at A. C. 704, 'sighernach re-
cording his death says: sstpmch mdc Oppu

reference to his sojourn in Ireland, is still pre-
