recorded desoent of the. N orthmen on Hy is 802, which is only five years anterior to
the writing of the Book of Armagh.

N otwithstanding this reputed intermeat, whether in Saul or Down, we find that
on the occasion of St. Blaithmae's martyrdom, in 82 5, St. Columba's shrine, which
was adorned with precious motals, was the chief object of the murderous N orthmen's
search3 so Walafridus Strabus states:

“Ad sanctum venere patrem, pretiosa metalla
Reddere cogentes, queis sancti sancta Columba?

Ossa jacent, quam quippe suis de sedibus arcam
Tollentes tumulo terra posuere cavato,

Quam sic repertam, et divina revelatione agnitam, aperiens

How soon. or by whom, the shrine was brought to light from its place of eoncealment,
is not recordo& but we know that it was soon after removed to Ireland, for in 878 it
was transferred, together with all St. Columba's mimm‘, to Ireland, for security from
the Danes, where it probably remained. Now, it is remarkable, that whereas we hear
of Adamnan's relies at 727, 730, within twenty-four years after his death, we find
no mention ofst. Columba's till eighty years afterwards. Possibly, indeed, in the pro-
m vation of the Lex Colm’mcille 'm 7 ς 3, 7 57, 778, his shrine may have been borne about
as the warrant for the exactiori of this religious tribute, and thus an indireet evidence
