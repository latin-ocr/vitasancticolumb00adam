k Styles.—From graphium, which is of Greek
origin, comes the Irish 5p01b (205 n.) The Life
of Cainnech represents that saint saying to Baithene,
“ porta illi tecum in signum qraffium hoc quod in
aere ex pallio ejus cadens reliquit, quum ille et ego
et Comgauus cito perreximus ad Eugenium episco-
pum Ardsrathae nos vocantem in auxilium circa
animam Aidui monachi suff—cap. 25 (p. 15, ed.
Ormonde). The very same anecdote is told in the
Life of St. Rmdhan, with this exception that the
style is called puqillaris, aud St. Ruadhan desciibed
as the keeper of it (Act. Sanctor. April. tom. ii.
p. 386 a3 Colg.‚ Tr. Th. p, 461 b). These styles
seemed to auswer a double purpose.

¹ Ink-horns.—The ink then in use was carbona-
ceous, not mineral. He writing in the Book ofAr-
magh, after 1050 years, is as blank as if executed
but yesterday.

¹1¹ Books. — At Armagh there was a ceGeh
Γοῐὶθορῦῐὶο, domus scripturarum, in 1020 3 and
an officer called teubon eoirheodo, mastos libro-
rum, in 1 136 3 but these are the only references in
our Annals to the existence of a monastic library.
As to Boece‘s story concerning the chest of manu-
scripts which King Pergus recovered from the spoils
oi* Rome, it would be sufficient to say that it is fully
as meai, and not half so rational, as any of AEsop's
compositions, were it not that there are some, whose
studies lying in another direction, may not be aware
that the alleged donation is supposed to have been
made 100 years before the Scotic dynasty was
founded in Scotland, 150 years before Columciue
set his foot in Hy, and by a king who never ex-
isted! Pope Pius 11. may have intended to visit

Hy, and might reasonably expect to find the oldest
books in the oldest monastery in the kingdom, espe—
cially had he known, as we do, that to an Irish
monastery on the Continent the literary world is
indebted for the preservation of some classical re-
mains3 but itis much to be feared that the result ol
the journey would have been similar to that of Mol<
denhauer‘s visit to Alcala7 and that AEueas Sylvius
would have had painful evidence that Dauish bon—
fires were as bad as Spanish rockets. See Ussher,
Brit. Ec. Ant. c. 15 (Wks. vol. vi. pp. 125, 241).
Bede‘s account of Acca's library is a reliable story
(H. E. v. 21). “

‘ When then Longarad died, it is told by the learned
that all the book-wallets of Ireland fell down on
that night. Or else it was the wallets in which
were the books of every scienee, in the apartment
where Columcille was, that then fell.¹ Gloss of the
Feilire, cit. Dr. Todd (Obits of Chr. Ch. Introd.
p. lxm.) The legend opens by saying that Lon-
garad hid his books from Columcille. Probably this
saint, like St. Finnian, did not wish to have his
books copied.
