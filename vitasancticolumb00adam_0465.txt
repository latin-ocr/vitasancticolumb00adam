ing one attendant (54, 84, 143), who oecasionally read to 111111 (65); or by two, who
stood at the door, awaiting his orders (216, 227). Ηο1·0 was his lectulus (²33)· Th(-
door was provided with a lock and key (22 3, 226). When a sti-anger arrived, a hospi-
tae'zmffl (27, 157) was prepared for him. then a member died, he was laid out, and
waked in his lodging (²39)-

There was a Smithy, probably inside the enclosru·e; and 111 an institution where
timber was so generally used, there must have been a carpentcr's work-
shop. We may conclude that there was such an appointment near the
beach also, for large boams of timber, 111 their rough state, were sometimes
floated from the shores of the mainland to the island, and fashionctl there into boats (176).

All these buildings were embraced by a rampart and fosse, called the 'vallam (143),
which, 111 other Irish monasteries, was of a circulor figure, and was intended more for
the restraint than the 50011111)- of the inmotos. It is doubtful whether the

pendages.

Outside the vallum* were the various offices and appointments subsidiary to the
monastery; as the Beretum, with its cows; the Horreum, with its grain;
the. Canaba, with its appiutenances; the Molenrlimon, with its pond and 111111- Sensum.
stream3 the Proede'zmoe, with its horse and cart; and the Portas, with its craft
of various sizes. These appendages occupied different situations, according to local
convenience.

The pastum-ground, with its bocetum or byrey (231), called by the Irish humbro
or booleys, was situate on the eastern side of the island, at some distance from
the monastery, and for this reason the lactaria Tuscula (125, 2 3 1) were usually nocetum.
conveyed on a horsc's back (231). The milk-pail had an operculum (126),
Which was sccured by a ι(Ιενςμῑηπα (z'b.), passing through bt’naforamina 111 the sides (ίό)

'Hospitium—111 some Irish monasteries there
was a separate department called ῑιΓ, or cech
οθιόθῠ, ‘ enclosure' or ‘ house of guests,' as in Ar-
magh (F. Most. 1003, 1015, 1116, 1155), aud
Clonmacnois (ib. 1031, 1093, 1106, 1128, 1166).

*z w Vallum—Such was the enclosure of Armagh

called puch anmoehu (F. Mast. 1091, 1112.
1 196). The monastery of Derry was erected in the
dun of Aedh (160). See pp. 24, 143, supra. In
1266, when the Franciscan monastery of Armagh,
now known as the Abbey in the Primate's Demesne,
was founded, they “cut a broad aud deep trench

around their church’' (Four Masters).

λ Outside the Vallum—The Benedictine Rule re—
quired that, if possible, “ omnia necessaria, id est,
Aqua, Molendinum, Hortus, pistrinum, vel Artes
diversae, intra monasterium exerceantur, ut non sit
necessitas monachis vagabundi foras* (cap. 66).

1 Rura—This shows how unfounded is the popu-
lar proverb, 'Sfar a 111-ὸί bo, bi'dh berum 'sfar α
m-bi bean, bi‘dlz mallaehadh. ‘Where there is a
cow there will be a woman3 and where there is a

woman there will be a curse.'
