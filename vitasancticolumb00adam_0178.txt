78 Vita Sancti Columbae

[Lm. 1.

per diem se occultare conatur, ut noctu ad parvam transnaviget insulamr ubi
marini nostri juris vitulig generantur et generant3 ut de illis ¹³furenter occisis
edax valde furax suam replens naviculam, ad suum repedet habitaculum. Qui
haeo audientes, obsecuti, emigrant, furemque in locis a Sancto praesignatis
absconsum reperiunt, et ad Sanctum, sicut illis praeceperat, perduxerunt.
Quo viso Sanctus ad eum ¹⁴dicit, Quare tu res alienas, divinum transgressus
mandatiun, saepe furaris ? Quando necesse habueris, ad nos veniens necessaria
accipies postulata. Et haee dicens praecipit ¹⁵verveces¹¹ occidi, et pro ¹⁶phocis
dari misero furaci, ne vacuus ad sua remearet. Et post aliquantum tempus
Sanctus, in spiritu vicinam fiiris praevidens mortem, ad 17Baitheneumi eo 18in

the entrance of Loch na Keal, on the west side
of Mull. Of these the latter lies nearer to Hy,
but does not answer the description here as well.
ist, it is likely Colosa was an inhabited island,
which Little Colonsay is not; znd‚ there would
be no advantage gained by crossing from Little
Colonsay‚ because the islands on that side are
nearer to it than to the shore, and his object in
landing was to be near his work; 3rd, there
are no “campuli mari vicini'⁷ or “arenarum
cumuli” on the west coast of Mull near Hy.
The name occurs again at ii. 22, where the
larger island seems to be again intended.
‘Insulam—Most probably Erraid lsle, the
largest of a little group of islands at the south
entrance of the Sound, south-east of Hy, and
close to the shore of Mull. Immediately oppo-
site to this island the sand is abundant on the
shore of Mun, but the coast is iton-bound
higher up, and so continues for a long distance.
The course from Colonsay was nbrth-west, for
about thirteen miles. The sti-anger landing on
the near end of Mull could then conveniently
cross over to the seal island. Selsey in Sussex
was anciently called “ Selaeseu, quod dicitur La-
tine insula Vituli marini.'' (Bede, Η. Ε. iv. 13.)

ix. 13). They are called phocae lower down.
The Irish term is non. These animals are
frequently seen on the islands in the neigh-
bourhood, but not so regularly or in such num-
bers as to constitute a preserve. Martin, writ-
ing in 1703, states that in Harris seals “ are eat
by the meaner people, who say they are very
nourishing⁷' (West. Islands, p. 36). On west
coast of Harris is the island Eousmil, a rock,
where is a yearly fishing of 58315, which belong
to the adjacent landholders. The parish mi-
nister has his choice of all the young seals, and
that which he takes is called Cullen Mory, i. e.
the Vix-gin Mary's Seal. So many as 320 have
been killed at one time. The natives salt the
fish with the ashes of burnt sea-ware. People
ofdistinction eat the hams only. (Ibid. pp. 61-
6 5.) See Hardiman's edition of O'Flaherty's
West Connaught‚ pp. 27, 95, 96.

abstemiousness of St. Columba appear to be
without foundation. See Praef. 2 (p. 9) supra.
