Additc'onal N otes. 3 89
fridus Sti-abus, twelfth abbot of Augia Dives=v‚ who flourished between 823 and 849, has written
a poem of 172 hexameters on the martyrdom of this ecclesiastic. He describes Blaithmaic as
“regali de stirpe satus‚” as ¹⁴ regius 1110195,Π and as “rex ille futurus⁷ genuit quem dives Hi-
bernia, mundo.'’ He states that, having become a monk, “agmina multorum rexit veneranda
virorum ;” and that, subsequently, coveting the crown of martyrdom, he betook himself to the
island of Eo, whither the pagan Danes had already on more than one occasion come. Expecting
their return, he counselled the members of the fraternity to save themselves by flight; whereupon
some departed, while others remained with him. The precious shrine containing St. Columba's
relics he deposited in the earth, and when, on the arrival os the plunderers, he refused to make

known the place of its concealment, they slew both him and his companions. This poem was

first printed by Canisius, and has since been frequently rcproduced (315).

wAuyia Dives-st is a remarkable coincidence
that this monastery (now Reiehenau) should furnish
the only narrative of St. Blaithmac's martyrdom,
and be the depository of the oldest manuscript of
Adamnan. Its familiarity with the ecclesiastical
affairs of the far west is aceounted sor by the fact
that this abbey was originally an Irish foundation.
Before its suppression, in 1799, it contained many
Irish MSS„ aud St. Findan's bowl is still preserved
in the sacristy. This saint is the Fiontann of Lem-
chaine who is commemorated in the Irish Calendar
at Nov. 16, and whose name occurs in the Ne-

crologium of Reichenau at the same day, “xvi Kl.
Dec. Findan Scottus.”

¹ Aidum.-This was Aedh Oirdnicffie, monarch
of [reland. His excommunication, which is de-
signedly omitted by the Four Masters, may have
been fox- his invasion of Tirconnell in 815, or be-
cause he was privy to Maelduin's death. He is said

to have made a royal decree in 804, excusing ecele-
siastics from military service. Tara, it is to be
obseroed, was occasionally resorted to as an ecclesi-
astical station, even asier it had ceascd to be inhab-
ited. See An. Ult. 779, and p. 179, supra.

1 Blaithmaci.-The name, which is a common
one⁷ is derived from blsse‚flos, and mue, filius, and,
as Colgan observes, may be latiuized Floriyenue, or
Florentius (Act. SS. p. 129 b). The Index of the
calendar of Donegal represents it by Floriyenius
and Florus, as it does btoch by F lora. Wala-
fridus strabus paraphrases the name by Pulcher
natus. St.Blaithmac's day is commemorated nbroad
on the 19th of ‹Ianum-y (Colg. Act. SS. p. 127), but
the Irish Calendar places his day at July 24.

² Tuathal mac Feradhaiclz.—Abbot of Rechra
and Durrow (an. 850= infra). Hence the associa-
tion of his name with Adamnan's shrine.

³ Scrinium Adanmani.—St. Clera, not Adamnan,
