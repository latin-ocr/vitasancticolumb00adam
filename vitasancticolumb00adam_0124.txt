—Cap 31. (Cod. Marsh.s01.147 ba; Tr. Th.
p. 457 b.) Itis certain that S. Columba was es-
tablished in Hy when the “magna domus'' of
Duri-ow was a-building. See i. 29, iii. 15, inf.
⁶ Cerani coeuobio.—Clonmaenoise was founded
in 548 by Ciaran mcc on c-room ⁴ Filius Ar-
tificis! King Diarmait (i. 14, 36 inf), his chief
patron, granted the site aud endowments. The
saint died on the 5th of Sept„ 549, in the 34th
year ofhis age. He was esteemed one of the
ohief saints of Ireland, and his monastery rose
ro the highest importance. Cummian's Paschal
epistle calls him Queranus Coloniensis, and
ranks him among the “ Patres p1·i0res'’ of the
Irish. (Ussher, Syll. xi.) The old adjectives
Clonoensis and coloniensis are formed from
Clnain, the first component in the name Ctuom
mio Now, ⁸ Meadow of son of Nos‚‘ which was
derived from Nos son of Fiadach. one of the
Dealbhna-Eathra, the tribe in whose district,
now known as the barony of Garrycastle in
King's County, the abbey was situate. Later
[rish writers added even another element to
the name (as Four Mast. 1461); but legal re-
cor-ds are generally content with the form
elmanensis, or elenensis: hence, as the See os
eloym, which in Irish is Cincin-nomba, is

also latinized by morlensis, it is sometimes diffi-
cult to distinguish between it and Clonmac-
noise, which was also a bishop’s See.

‘¹ Ayellnlt's viduis,—-Agrieulture was probably
a leading occupation under St. Ciaran's, as well
as St. Columba's rule, attracting to the neigh-
bourhood the external dependents who are al-
luded to in the text.

θ Alitlzerum.—F0urth abbot of Clonmacnoise,
having succeeded Mae Nissi, who died June
ath, 585. His death is recorded by Tigher-
nach at 599: Gilichip abb Cluana mac Νοιῐ·

os Cluain-mio-Nois rests. He was of the Mus-
craidhe.'—( Annal. Ult. 598; Four Mast. 595.)
He appears in the Calendar at May 12: Θῑιεὴηι

s Vallum monasteria—The rampart which is
described by Bede as enclosing St. Cuthbert's
little monastery iu Farne may be taken as the
type οῖ’ the Irish monastic vallum. (H. Ε, iv.
28; more fully in Vita S. Cuthberti, cap. ¹7·)
