3 1 2 Additional Notes. [11.

With respect to the notation of Tighemach⁵ at this year, it must be confessed that
it contradicts the ent-ry. For it is K. 1111., 11131 15, that the first 0133119315- fell on
Wedncsday, which makes E the Dominical letter, and thus refers the occul-rences under
that signature to 598, 1110 years later than is deducible stom the entries. We might
suppose am. by a very 90111111011 mistake put for .uu., which would mend the matter
a little, and the antecedent signatures might be treated in 1119 same manner3 but then
1119 .11. 11111911 would become .u. would 1131971111. as its antecedent, whereas 3 ,1. 15
found in situ. The Annals of fflster record the occurrence thus, Quies Colm'm cille 1.
Id. Jun. anno etatis sue lxxx-i. But their signature is vii„ which gives B 1151119 Sunday-
letter, and indicates 595, 1119 very year in their margin, for where they say 594, they
mumt 595. Now it is evident that their record of the event has been 3111159111)-
framed; and, therefore, it is hard to conceive on what principle they could refer the
919111 10 50 early a year. In it, Easter fell 011 1119 3rd of April, and Whitsunday on
the zznd of May, and the 9th of June was Thursday.

The choice‚ 111911, 1195 between 596 and 597. To the former Colganu and Dr.
O'Conor‘ incline; to the latter the graver judgments of Ussherw, O'Flahertyx, and
Lam'ganr: but the question would not 11319 3115911 if Tighernach had not mentioned
Pentecost ; and 11 has been shown that, 91911 011 1115 high authority, the introduction of
this element into the caleulation 15 irreconcilable with the explicit statements of
both himself and Adamnan.

Tuus it appears that during 11 century, at least, after the death of St. Columba, hjs
remains were permitted to lie undisturbed in the earth. Ven. Bede extends the period

⁵ Tiyhernacln.-—It has been 1915· much the habit
to extol this chronicler as a most accurate chronolo-
gist, but it is to be remembered that the years printed
in the margin by O'Conor are O'Conor's mon, not
Tighernach's. He generally adjusts thern by adding
one to the years set down for the parallel entries in
the Annals of Ulster. This is very often done in op-
position to the author-'s 011-11110111ῐί011. In the whole
range of Irish literary desiderata no work is more
imperatively demanded than a faithful exhibition of
Tighernach's text. Iu O'Conor, it 15 so corrupt, so
interpolated. so blundered, that it is extremely un-

5319 to trust the text, while it is certain mischief to
follow the translation.
