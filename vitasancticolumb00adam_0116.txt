1 6 Vita Sancti Columbae

[Lm. 1.

Domino, sicut ei promissum est, felix et facilis est concessa victoria, et rege
‘trucidato ²⁹Catlone²‚ victor post ³⁰bellum reversus, postea totius Britanniae

imperator* a Deo ordinatus esth.

Hanc mihi ³¹Adan1nan0⁶ narrationem meus

decessor, noster abbas Failbeusd‚ indubitanter enarravit, qui se ab ore ipsius
Ossualdi regis, Segine0² abbati eamdem enuntiantis visionem, audisse pro-

testatus est.

-Bede, H. E. iii. 1.

⁷ Trucidato Conona—⁴⁵ In loco qui lingua
Anglorum Denisesbmna, id est, Rivus Denisi
vocatur.''-—Bede‚ H. E. iii. 1. The British
gave it a different name : ⁵‘ Osuuald filius Ead-
fred regnavit novem auniS, ipse est Osuuald
Lamnguin [pulchrae manus] ; ipse occidit Cat-
gublaun regem Guenedotae regionis in bello
Catscaul cum magna clade exercitus sui.''—
2-Nennius‚ H. B. ξ 64 (Ed. Stev.) Bede and
the Saxon Chronicle place the battle in 635,
but the Irish and VVelsh Annals earlier:

Geoffrey of Monmouth, perverting Bede's
narrative, states that Oswald, having ovcrcome
cadwalla at Heavenfield, was afterwards de-
feated at Burne, and killed by Penda. He
also represents Cadwalla as surviving Oswald
many years, and dyingjn the arms of peace;
while he reserves the final prostration of the
Britons for the twelfth year of his son’s reign.

³¹ Ford. Adomnano Α.

Scottorum, et Anglorum divisae sunt, in ditione
accepit.'‘-—Bede, H. E. iii. 6. The present pas-
sage is cited by Mr. Hallam as “probably a
distinet recognition of the Saxon word Bret-
walda; for what else could answer to Emperor
of Britain? It seems more likely that Adam-
nan refers to a distinet title bestowed on Os-
wald by his subjects, than that he means to
assert as a fact, that he truly ruled over all
Britain.'' But this idea is not iu harmony with
Adamnan'sor Bede's assertion. Mr. Hallam
certainly errs in asserting that Cummineus‘ Life
of st. Columba “is chiefly taken from that by
Adamnan.'·—Middle Ages, vol. ii. p. 350 (Lond.
1853). See Saxon Chron. A. D. 827, where Os-
wald is set down as the sixth king “who was
Bret-walda.‘¹—(Monum. Hist. ΒΓ. p. 343); Lin-
gard, Hist. Engl. cap. ii.
