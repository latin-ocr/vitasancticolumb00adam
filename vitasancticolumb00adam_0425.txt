find recorded in the Annals of Ulster‚ at 1 166, the violation of a contract which had

, been solemnized in presence of the Coarb of Patrick with the Bac-hall J esu, and of the

coarb of Columcille with the Gospel of Martia. But it was lost soon after3 for, in
1 182, “ Donnell, son of Hugh O'Loughlin, marched with an army to Dunbo, in Dal-
Riada, and there gave battle to the English. The Kinel-Owcn were defeated; and
Randal O'Breslen, Gilchreest O’Kane, and many others, were killed. On this occasion
the English carried off with them the Gospcl of st. Martin.’' The legend concerning
the invention of this manuscript is borrowed by O’Donnell from the Acts of St. Euge-
nius of Ardstraw and St. Mochouna, or Machar, the patron saint of Aberdeen. It
relates that the people of Tours had lost the clue to the exact spot where St. Martin’s
remains were buried, and that on the occasion of St. Columba’s visiting their city they
applied to him to point out the place where the body of their patron saint lay, which
he consented to do on condition that he should receive for his portion everything found
in the grave, except the bones of Martin. “ Conditione facilc admissa, vir Sanetus
locum, in quo sacrum corpus jacebat, indigitat, in eoque mox defosso simul cum (lesi-
deratis exuviis cum Missarum reperiretur liber¹3 factae sponsionis Turonenses prope
poenituit, detrectantes inventum Missale Columbae poscenti consignare, nisi ille priori
beneficio alteram adhuc adderet gratiam, et Turonensi Ecelesiae administrandae aliquem
e suis sociis virum sanctum et idoneum praeficiendo relinqueret. Quod ipsum postea-
quam vir Sanctus annuerat, et Sanctum illis Mochonnam velut jam antea a summo
Pontifice pro Turonensi sede destinatum, praesentarat, assecutus est desideratiun B.
Martini librum⁷'¹²².

Now, though it is very unlikely that St. Columba ever travelled beyond the British
Islands, the above legend is interesting as an indication of the early connexion which
existed between Ircland and the church of Tours. St. Martin is represented as St.
Patzrick’s grand-uncle, and as a principal agent in his mission to Ircland. In the next
age, his body is reported to have been discovered by the great monastic patron of Ire-
land, and his ritual transferred from Tours to Derry. And in later times the holy wells
of Deny, called cobus· mopcom, cobop Geminium, and cobop Coluim, preserved
the local association of his name with those of the fathers of the Columbian ordern.

¹ Missurum Libera—It is called a roweeto, ox·
yospel, in other authorities, but the British and
lrish extended the term to a formulary containing
portions of the Gospel read inDivine Service. Thus
in St. Caidoc's Life we find ‘⁴ Cum beatus Gildas in
insula Echni Deo ministeriis mancipatus degeret,
missalem librum scripsit, illumque sancto Cadoco
obtulit, quum illius Confessor extitit, ideoque codex
ille Evanqelium Gildae vocatzu.”-Rees‚ Cambro-

Brit. SS. p. 66. The vag-ue acceptation of the term
appears 'm the gloss on the Felire, at St. Finnian‘s
day, as translated by Colgan: ‘⁴ Ferunt quod Fin-
nianus de Magbili tulerit libros Legis Moysaicae
primo ad Hiberniam, si hoe verum ε vel per Libros
Legis intelliguntur &angelium-Acta Sanctorum,
