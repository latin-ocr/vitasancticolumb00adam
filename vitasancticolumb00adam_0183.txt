kerton‘s Auteriorum is both unmeaning and
unauthorized. The word is the genitive of
Anteriores, which Adamnan cmploys instead of
the more obvious Orientales. In this he is sup-
ported by two remarkable passages. The first
is a line in the alleged druidical prophecy os St.
Patrick's coming (Petrie's Tara, pp. 53, 54):

G miore ι n-uipcep o ειδῐ,

which Muirchu, in the Book of Armagh, renders
“A sua mensa. ex anteriore parte domus suae''
(fol. 2 b α), and Probus by the same words (Vit.
S. Patr. c. 26, Tr. Th. p. 49 α). In the scholia
on Fiech's Hymn, however (Tr. Th. p. 5b),
the second, third, and fourth Lives of St. Patrick
in Colgan's collection (ib. pp. 14⁴1, 23 b, 40 a),
as well as Jocelin, c. 3¹ (ib. 71 b), and Colgan's
version of the Tripartite Life (i. 43, ib. 123b),
the word nisiben is rendered by the more com-
mon expression oriem, or orientalis playa. The
other passage occurs also in the Book os Ar-
magh, where Muirehu, relating St. Patrick's
course along the coast of Leinster and Ulster‚
notices the little island of Inis Padruic, now
St. Patrick's island, off Holmpatriek on the
east coast (Ord. Surv. Co. Dublin‚ s. 5), in
these words :—‘ Ad anteriorem insolam quae ejus
nomine usque hodie nominatur prurim navis
convertit’ (fol. 2 l> b). In this use of the word,
the writers had reference to the primary notion
entertained by the Irish of the cardinal points,
which supposed the face turned to the East.
(⁴contra ortum solis: Lib. Armac. fol. 12 a a),
constituting this point, which is (nn ante, the
οιῃὸιῃ anterior (like the Heb. ΕἻΡ, which from
antrorsum comes to signify oriens), that is the
East; the iun playa postica (Heb. -nrm retro.
then occidens), the &vesu that on the Depp

dextra (Heb. ἴῃ· dexter. then meridies) the oep-
cem: dextralis playa, or South3 and that on
the cuut': sinistra, the tuuipcepc playa sinis-
tralis, or North. But the use of riylit and left
for south and north is much more frequent in

the Latin of Celtic writers than sore or rear.
Thus dextera, Lib. Armac. fol. 3αα, 3 ba, 6ba,
18 α α ; sinistralis, ib. sol. 2 b b. 7 a ὂς Nen-
nius, ἐξ 12, 42, 62. (Ed. Stev. pp. ιο, 34, 52.)
On the use of these two words see Ussher, Brit.
Eccl. Ant. v. xv. (Wks. vol. v. p. 103, vi. pp. 1 14,
187); Zeuss, Gram. Celt. pp. 67, 283, 566; Pe-
trie's Tara, pp. 41, 423 Irish Nennius, p. 41.
In the present case Anteriores is a radical equi-
valent for the Irish Giptbeupu, a name which
was applied to the eastern section of the Airghi-
alla„ or inhabitants of the territory afterwards
called Oriel or Uriel. The Airgbialla were
the descendants ofColla Dachrich‚ and derived
their name from Om 6¹01le ‘ golden homage-ss
(O'Donovan on Book ofRights‚ p. 140.) They
were represented in the Middle Ages by the
Mac Mahons, Maguires, O'Hanlous, and Mac
Canus. When St. Patrick founded the church
of Armagh, a descendant of Colla. was king 01*
the Airtheara, whose territory contained the
greater part of the present county of Armagh.
Accordingly, Tirechan places the church οἵ
Armagh in reyz'onibns Orientalium, and repre-
sents the orientales as striving to obtain
possession os St. Patrick's remains (Lib. Ar-
macan. fol. 6bh, εἶπα). The Tripartite Life
also represents Daire as king of the region
called Oirelzir, id ese, Orientalis (iii. 71, Tr.
Th. 162 b). Ronan's father was lord of the
territory in St. Columba's time. Subsequently
the name Airthear underwent limitation: the
district round Armagh became appropriated
