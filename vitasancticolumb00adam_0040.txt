high book-chest, where it lay Pele-mele with some other MSS. and old books
totally neglected, bearing neither title nor number-’⁵ It was twice borrowed
by Dr. Keller, and on the latter occasion, in 18 5 1, he made a valuable collection
of facsimiles from it, and through Mr Mors, a person of considerable learning
and experience in manuscripts, secured a most minute collation of the text
with the printed edition in the Bollandists, the results of which, with the
greatest kindness and liberality, he placed at the service of the present editor.

II. Codex Β. A vellum MS. of the middle of the fifteenth centiuy, pre-
served in the British Museum, Bibl. Rey. 8 D. ix. The text agrees in its
main features with that of A. It has, however, capitulationes for the second
and third books, which do not exist in A, and a paragraph in the middle of
the second book (ii. 20). These have been introduced into the present work
(pp. 100, 188, 131). It also contains a recital of the names of St. Columba’s
twelve (liscililes, and of his immediate kinsmen. This appendage, which comes
without a break immediately after the text in the manuscript, is not an integral
part of the work; but as it is evidently very ancient and trustworthy, it forms
the subject of Additional Note A (pp. 245-247) in the present work. The
manuscript wants about a quaternio at the beginning, and commences abruptly
in the middle ofi. 3 (25). This defect is of old standing, for the name chmley,
written at the foot of the first page, is the signature of John, Lord Lumley⁰‚
who died in 1609. Otherwise, the manuscript is in unexceptionable preser-
vation; the vellum clean, and the writing distinct. The capitals are large
and massive, in red and blue alternately3 those at the beginning of sections or
paragraphs smaller, but coloured in like manner: the tituli are in rubrio. As
to orthography, it never uses (Β or oe, and rarely αες it generally has c instead
of t in such words as tercius,· aspirates initial vowels, as heremus, hostium ,-
doubles medial consonants, as occemlusg obeys assimilation, as illacrimans ,· has
no y; is indistinct in the combination of mininis, in the letters i, m, 11, ῖι;
generally reads the name iona ; has no capitals as initials of proper names3
and, though using various forms of stops, has no fixed rule of punctuation.

It is in a large 8vo vol. consisting of 144 fols. or 288 pages. The con-
tents of the volume are, S. Columbae sita, fol. 1 α to 70 a ; Ire-qula Auyustim',
