Cainle unappropriated, Mons Cainle certainly
would not suit the plain of Bregia, or the vici-
nity of Trevet. It was more probably in Scot-
land. In this view the word vicinus in next
chapter will have reference to the Saint's pre—
vious place of sojourn, and not to the relation
of the monastery and region, for Trevet was
ιἰι Bregia.

³ Memorata reyione.—Probably⁷ not the reqio
Cainle of last chapter, but the Campus Brey of
chap. 38. It is worthy of observation that the
shorter recension of Adamnan's text, repre-
sented by Canisius and Messingham, contains
the present chapter, but omits all that have in-
tervened between chap. 33 and it. Therefore
we must in that text look to chap. 33, οι· one
immediately preceding, for the correlative to
the present words: but the island of Skye is
the subject of ehap. 33, and Hy of the preced-
ing ones. It follows, then, that as the foremen-
tioned region is in this chapter identified with
that iu which Trevet is situate, neither Skye
nor Hy can be the place referred to3 and that
there must be a chasm in the shorter text3 in
other words, that the shorter is an abbrevia-
tion of Adamnan’s original, and not, as Dr. La-
nigan would have it, that the present text is
interpolated. (Eecl.Hist. ii. pp. 109, 246.)

‘¹ Morzasterioeum—Praef. z, ii. 7. This diminu-
tive is also found in Bede, where he describes
Dicul the Scot as ‘⁴ habens monasteriolum per-

“ modicum in loco qui vocatur Bosanhamm, silvis

In the Four Masters the form Cnepou: is occa-
sionally found, which is agreeable to the etymon
cm pom· ‘three sods' given in some ancient au-
thorities cited by O’Donovan (Four Mast. 734),
and Petrie (Round Towers, pp. 97, 99). St.
Lonan, who is commemorated at Nov. 1, was
probably the founder: Loncm o (pepone ι
ηὼῐιθδωῖ) (15 boum, ‘Lonan of Trefoit in
Bregia, on the Boyne.'—Cal. Dungall. It is
styled monasteriolum in the text, and appears
to have been, though an ancient, for some time
an inconsiderabie, establishment, as neither the
name nor date of itsfounder occursinthe Aunals,
and the first time it is noticed is 739. However
it subsequently rose to importance, and was ad-
ministered by episcopal abbots in 769, 898, aud
1004. From the supposed similarity of the
name to Tredagh. the English form ofDrogh-
eda, O'Conor and others have been led to
identify it with that town3 but enoneously,
sor its true representative in modern topogra-
phy is Trevet, a parish in the barony of Skreen,
and county of Meath⁷ a little south-east of the
conspicuous church of Skreen. (Ord. Surv.
s. 38.) This church of Skreen was formerly
called Scrin celuim-cille, and is mentioned by

schola dicitur.'⁷
