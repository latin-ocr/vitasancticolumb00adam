Cathbarr O'Donnell, son of Gillachrist [ob. 1038]y son of Cathbarr, son of Domhnall
Mor, the progenitor of the O‘Donneffs, was chief of the Cinel Luighdech0, and died in
1 106. DomhnaH Mac Robhartm'ghv, successor of Columba at Kells, died, according to
the Four Masters, in 1098. His name occurs also in the charters which are entered
111 the blank peges of the Book of Kellsq. Sitric was son of Mac AEdha, who was sur-
named Cerd, that is, ‘Artificem' in the Chmters of Kells, where mention is made of
Flami mae Mic Aedlza also. The family of Mac Aedha¹ seem to hare been the here-
ditary mechanics of KeUs. It is interesting to observe the relation here recorded as
subsisting, through the Columbian system, between remote parts of Ireland: O’Don-
nell being lord of a territory in the extreme north of the island, yet associated with
the abbot of a midland monast-2153 and that abbot the member, of a family which also
was seated in the remote nortlr, supplying herenachs to two churehes in St. Columba’s
region of Tireonnell, and occasionally appeaxing in the administration of St. Columba⁷s
church of Derry. In 1497 the Catlmclz was employed for military purposes, but failed
of procuring victory for its possessors. Con O’Donnell led an army into Moylurg in
Connaught, to attack Mac Del-mott, but was defeated at the battle of Bealach-buidhe.
Mae Robhmaigh, the keeper [moop] of the Cathach of Columcffle, was slain, and the
Cathach taken from the Tirconallians. Two years after, it was restored—(Pom Mas-
ters.) In the early part of the sixteenth century it was still the. great reliquary of
Tirconnell; and in the following century it continued to be in the custody of the
family of Mac Robhartaigh, the official keepers under the Lord of Tirconnell. When
it reappears in the next century, it is found in the possession of the head of the O’Don-
nell family, who recorded his guardianship in an inscriptiont on the silver frame which
he made for its presel-ration: [acono 3. M. B. REGE EXULANTE, DANIEL ο 120an m
