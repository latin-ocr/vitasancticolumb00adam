Preface. ix

ium, adding titles to the chapters‚ and appending a few marginal glosses‚
together with testimonias of Adamnan, at the beginning, and of St. Columba,
at the end, of the Life.

About the same time, Stephen W'hitec⁵ a learned Jesust, a native of Clon-
mel, discovered, while in search of Irish manuscripts on the Continent, a
venerable copy of Adamnan in the Benedictine monastery of Reichenau‚ and
the transcript which he made supplied the text of the fourth Life of St. Co-
lumba in Colgan’s Trias Thaumaturgad, published in ¹647· The editor of the
work prefixes numbers to the chapters, which are not in the original, and errs
wherever White has made an omission or alteration in the text, but in other
respects is remarkably faithful. The notes display considerable learning and
vast acquaintance with the ecclesiastical records of his country, but his conjec-

ιαηο Abbate. Ex tomo 4. antiquoe lectionis Hem-ici
canisii, ξω, aceompanied by an engraving of the
saint, habited in his cowl‚ having a mitre lying
at his feet, and underneath, the motto Quis da-
bit milti pennas sicut Columbae, el volabo, et requi-
escam ?—pp. 141-184.

⁶ Whice.—His Apoloqia pro Hibernia adver-
sus Canibri calumnias was printed in 1849 by
the Rev. Matthew Kelly, from a MS. preserved
in Brussels. White lent his copy of the Reichen-
au MS. to Ussher previously to 1639, who occa-
sionally refers to it3 thus, speaking of Vitus's
identification of lepnun and Ferreolus (237), he
adds: “Ita enim habebat antiquissimum quo
ille usus est, ex Benedictino Augiae Divitis in
Suevia eoenobio petitum, exemplar” (Wks. vi.
p. 54¹)· Elsewhere he cites it as Auyiens. MS.
(ib. p. 245, and iv. p. 456), or Vet. MS. (vi. pp.
523, 526, 527, 530). White furnished Ussher
with many other sruits of his Continental
searches, which the Archbishop acknowledges
(Wks. vi. pp. 269, 274); and a folio MS. of
Ussher‘s, containing these eommunications of
White's, was lately sold by ΜΓ. Kerslake of
Bristol. The long extract from the anony-
mous Life of St. Columba which Ussher has
printed, “ut a Stephano Vito humanissime
communicatum accepimus” (Wks. vi. p. 466),
is most probably from White's own pen. The

Arehbishop in another place records a literary
performance. “ a Stephano Vito viro antiqui-
tatum, non Hiberniae solum suze sed aliarum
etiam gentium seientissinio” (Wks. v. p. 458).
lt is refreshing to witness the literary friend-
ship which existed in this case between men of
different communions, and in an age when party
feeling ran high; a tie which, in like manner,
bound Ussher to Sirmondus and David Roth.
There is less satisfaction at finding ward, in
the same page of his Rumold. passing from the
“ doctissimus polyhistor Stephanus vitus·· to
“Jacobus Usserius hodiernus Armachanze Se-
dis Pseudo-primas, sacrarum antiquitatum Bri-
tannicarum vir peritior (quod dolendum plane)
quam sequacioff' (p. 180).
