An. fflt. relate the occurrence more succinctly,
but in the exact form of the text: A. C. 636,
Bellum Roth. An ancient historica] romanoe,
called The Battle osllsayh Rath, was published
in the original Irish, with a translation and
notes, for the Irish Archaeological Society, in
1842, by Professor O‘Donovan. This curious
tale, while it contains many statements that are
inaccurate, seems in its main features to have
been founded upon fact, and supplies the infor-
mation which is required to identify the ac-
counts ofAdamnan and the Annals. It states
that Congal Claen, the prime mover of the ex-
peditiom was maternal grandson of Eochaidh
Buidhe, and consequently that Domhnall Brcae
was his uncle. That, flying to Alba, he pre-
sented himself at his grandfather's court of
Dun Monaidh (p. 46), at Sliabh Monaidh (p.56).
Which place is identified by some with Dun-
staffnage (Battle of Magh Rath, p 46; Irish
Nennius, p. 285), but on insufficient grounds.
Edinburgh is called Dim Monaidlz on the title
ofBishop Carsewell's Psalms. (See als'o Trans.
Gael. Soc. p. 118.) The following summary
of the tale is given by Charles O'Conor of
Belanagare: “ Domnall. son of Aodh, the son
of Ainmirey, ascended the throne, and began
his administration with an act of extreme jus-
tice; that of taking vengeance on the mur-
derer of his predecessor. Congal Claon he
defeated in the battle of Dunkehern (see p.
95, supra), and obliged him to fly into Britain.
Congal Claon remained nine years in exile.
Saxons, Britons‚ Albanian Seots⁷ and Picts
flocked to his standard. His domestic par-
tizans prepared for his reception, and he landed
safely on the coast of Down. Domuall, king
of Ireland. was not unprepared. He imme-

diately encamped near the enemy at Moyrath,
and began as bloody a battle as can be found
in the records of that age: it continued with
various success for six whole days, until vic-
tory declared·for the nation on the seventh,
Congal Claon, the soul of the enemies' army,
was defeated und slain at the head ofthe troops
of rlad. The foreign troops were scon broke
with great slaughter 3 and Domnal Breac, King
of the Albanian Scots, hardly escaped to Bri-
tain, with the sorry remains os a fine army,
which should be employed sor the defence os thc
people hc so wantonly attacked-''—Dissert. on
Hist. of Ireland, p. 210 (Dubl. 1812). Fordun.
who notices this prophecy‚ represents iEdan
as acting “contra B. Columbae monita& and
paying the penalty iu defeat (Scotichr. iii. 27);
but he omits to notice the real drift of the al-
leged prediction. Magh Rath is supposed to
be the modern Moira, a well-known village and
parish in the county of Dowm but as the iden-
tification is based upon the name alone, the
existence of other places in the county of Down
similarly called, renders the supposition doubt-
ful; especially as the chief clue given in the tale
leads to the neighbourhood uf Newry (pp. 274,
276). The places mentioned in connexion with
the battle, Maylz-comair (pp. 1 ιο, 227), Tulclum-
na-dtaillyeann (p. 1 19), Βαίνε-ίη-ΙαίΙια, Cara
Conyail (p. 174), Ard-nwlzimaircsi (p. 180).
Cnocan-an-choscair (p. 2 16)7 and Alb-an-ornaimli
(p. 226), will probably determine the situation.
