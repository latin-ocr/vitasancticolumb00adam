·’ Sale.-See chap. 19 (p. 128) supra. The
river Shiel‚ which connects the fresh-water lake
of Loch Shiel with the sea, and forms part of

‚the boundary between the enunties of Inverness
and Argyle, is excluded from identification with
the name in the text, because it was a S. E. wind
which conveyed the party from it to Hy, where-
as a N. E. wind would be required to do this
from beyond Ardnamurchan. We must there-
fore leave this name unidentified.

⁴ Duodecim curnem—We find this number
prevailing, during the early ages of Chris-
tianity, in almost every department osreliqious
economy. See iii. 4, infra. lt waS, however,
largely adopted in secular use also: thus we
read of Vortigern¹s 12 Druids <Irish Nennius,
p. 90); the η battles of Arthur (Π). p. 108);
the 840 [70 >< 12] men whom he slew in one
day (lb. p. 112); the 12 soldiers and Cadoc
(vit. Cad. c. 5. Rees, Lives, p. 32): the 12 horse-
men (lb. c. 20, p. 53); the 12 workmeu (lb.
c. ¹7² p. 46); the η compauions of Oswald
(i. 1, p. 15, supra); the 12 soldicrs of Eanfrid
(Bede, H. E. iii. 1); Oswy's donation of the
“duodecim possessiunculae terrarum’' (lb. iii.
24); and the crew of 12 in the Orkney boat
(Johnstone‚ Antiqq. Celt. Scand. p. 262).

Ε Renovandum monasterium-See note ⁸, cap.
3 (p. 106) supra. An improvement seems to
have been made, before this, on the* rude sys-
tem of building with wattles. St. Columba
used to study in a hut “tabulis suffultum'’ (i.
25, p. 54, supra). St. Finan, iu 652, erected a
church after the model of Hy, “quam more
Scottorum, non de lapide, sed de robore secto
totam composuit. atque harundine texit ;’' that
is, the walls were made of wooden sheeting,
which was protected from the weather outside

by a coat of rush thatch. An improvement
was again made on this system when a suc-
ceeding bishop, “ ablata harundine, plumbi
laminis eam totam. hoc est, et tectum et ipsos
quoque parietes ejus cooperire curavit’' (Bedev
H. E. iii. 25). In the same manner Paulinus,
having visited Glastonbury (the Inyswitrin of
note ³, p. 106, supra), “ muros vetustae ecelesiae
ligneo tabulatu construere fecit, et extra a
summo usque deorsum in terram plumbo un-
dique cooperire secit'' (Gul. Malmesbur, ap.
Ussher,Wks. v. p. 141). The ehurch of St. Peter
at York was also first “de ligno’' (Bede. H. E.
ii. 14). Stone building was considered at the
time characteristic of Roman practice. Ni-
nian's church of Whithern, among the southern
Picts, got its name Candida Casa “eo quod
ibi eeclesiam (le lapide, insolito Brittonibus
more fecerit'' (lb. iii. 4); and Naiton, king of
the northern Picts, in 710, “architectos sibi
mitti petiit, qui juxta morem Romanorum ec-
clesiam de lapide in gente ipsius facerent'' (lb.
v. 2¹). Thus also Biscop Benedict, in ⁶76·
brought over from Gaul Ηι’(ειηεηῐανὶοε qui lapi=
deam sibi ecclesiamjuxta Romanorum morem
facerent'' (Id. Hist. Abb. Wirem. ξ 5). 111 Irc-
land the national taste seems to have displaycd
itself in the same manner as in Britain. When
St. Palladius came to 1re1and, “tres ecclesias
de robore extructas sundavit” (Jocel. c. 25, Tr.
Th. p. 70 b). St. Patrick visited Tirawley, ‘¹ et
fecit ibi aecclesiam terrenam de humo quadra-
tam quia non prope erat silva'' (Tirechan, Lib.
Armac. fol. 14b h). St. Monenna of Cill-Sleibhe-
Cuilinn, died in 517· Derlaisre was her third
successor: “ In cujus tempore contigit in omni
Scotia famosum et tam grande miraculum.
