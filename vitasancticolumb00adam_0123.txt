Latin equivalent Roboreti Campus at i. 29· 49,
ii. 39, iii. ¹5? and Roboris Campus at ii. 2.
Speaking of Columba, Bede says: “Fecerat
autem, priusquam Brittaniam veniret, monaste-
rium nobile in Hibernia, quod a eopia roborum
Dearmaclt lingua Scottorum, hoc est, Campus
roborum, cognominatur.”—(H. E. iii. 4.) The
modern name is Durrow. and belongs to a
pai-ish of the diocese of Meath, situate in the
barony of Ballycowan, on the north of King's
County, and extending a short way into West-
meath. It anciently formed part of the terri-
tory Fer-Ceall, which was included in the king-
dom of Teathbha [Teffia]. On the death of
Crimsszann, in 533, the lordship descended to
his nephew Aedh, whose father, Brendan, sur-
vived till 576, but does not appear to have en-

Darmach on Colum-cille,'' died in 589. S. Co-
lumba removed to Iona in 563: Aedh became
lord of Teffla in 553: it follows, therefore. if
Bede's statement be correct, that Durrow was
founded between these dates. But the present
narrative, while it describes S. Columba as

this expression in the sense of confirming), or
suppose an inaccuracy in Bede. Ifit could be
proved that Breudan was lord of Teffia, Bede
would be shown to be in error, for that prince
lived ¹1¹15763, so that his son Aedh would not
have the right of donation before that date.
which was thirteen years subsequent to S. Co-
lumba's departure. A similar conclusion would
follow from the identification of the visit nien-
tioned in the text with the following, which is
recorded in the Life of S. Ciaran: “Post lon-
