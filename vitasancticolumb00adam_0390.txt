once the residence of the monks of Iona'’³. And a visitor of more recent date observes:
“A water-spring at the head of a narrow creek in the adjacent shore is called St. Co-
lumba’s Well;⁷’ adding, what seems an imported tradition, that a little pile on the
summit of a neighbouring height was said to be “the tomb of AEthnea, mother of the
illustrious saint''¹‘. The adjacent island is called Czclbramlon, 1. 6. Secessus Brendtmi.

3. Loca Cotmmun-On the north—west of the parish of Kilmuir, in the island
of Skye. See the description of its monastic remains at p. 138, supra. The particu-
lars of its draining are to be found in the New Statistieal Account, vol. xiv. pt. 1,
pp. 246, 267, 279. 1t may be a question whether the island of Skye belonged to the
Piets or to the Seots in St. Golumba⁷s time: the anecdote told in i. 33 (p. 62) supra,
seems in favour of the former. Tighernaeh, at 668 (An. Ult. 667), records the IVavi-
,elatio filiorum Gai-{naith ad Hiberniam cum plebe Sez'th; and at 670 (An Ult. 669),
Venit Gens Gartnac't (le Hibernia,- where Scitla probably denotes Skye. In this case
thefilii Gartnm't may have been the family of Gartnait, the youngest son of King
AEdan, who had occupied the island : but this is not likely, as the Oinel Gabhrain, to
which they belonged, were the most southern settlers of the Scotio colony. Thefile'i
Gartnaz‘t were rather the sons of Gartnait mac Uuid, the Pictish king in 636, or of his
¹successor Gartnait mac Domhnall, who died in 663. In this case the change of settle-
ment, in 668, may hare. been caused by Scotio oeenpation. However, when Adamnan
wrote, the mountain of the Dorsum Brz'tamu‘oe being considered the boundary line, the
islands on the west would necessarily fall to the Soots. Hence the legend of St. Com-
gan in the Aberdeen Brevi-ary states that the adjacent parish on the mainland of
Lochelch [now Loehalsh] was in Erchadz'a boriali ⁰, or North Argyle.

4. &inmenens—Of this island, which lies N. W. of the extreme north point
of Slqe, Mar-tin writes: “Fladda Ghzmn (i. e.) F ladda of the Ocean, lies about two
Leagues distant from the West-sz'de of fflmzfslz-point, it is two Miles in Compass, the
Ground is boggy, and hut indifferent for Corn or Grass. There is a Chappel in the
Islc dedicated to St. columbus, it has an Altar in the Eruet-end, and there is a blue
Stone of a round Form on it, which is always meist 3 It is an ordinary Custom, when
any of the Fishermen are detained in the Isle, by contrary Winds, to wash the blue
Stone with water all round, expeeting thereby to procure a favourable Wind, which
the Credulous Tenant lixing in the Isle says never fails, especially if a Stranger wash
the St0n03 The Stone is likewise applied to the sides of People troubled with Stitches,
and they say it is effectual for that purpose. And so great is the regard they have for
this Stone, that they swear decisive Oaths on it. The Monk 0 Gorqon is buried near
to this Chappel, and there is Stone five foot high at each end of his Grave‘’‘¹‚. This
