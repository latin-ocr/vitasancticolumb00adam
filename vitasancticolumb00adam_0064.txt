On the death of Failbhc, in 679, Adamnan was elected to the abbaey of Hy, being
now fifty-five years of age. Bruide, son of Bne, the most valiant of the Pictish kings
since the reign of his namesake, the son of Maeleon, preceded the abbot in his eleva-
tion but onc year, so that Adamnan's incumhency is set down in the Chronielo of the
Scottish Kings⁰ as the ecclesiastic-al parallel of his reignd. Aldffid, the Nerthumbrian
prinee, whom the Irish know as Flann Fina⁹‚ was now an exile in Irelauds. Thither
he had probably been led through his mother's alleged connexion with the chief family
of the north, and here probably it had beon that Adamnan commenced that intimacy
which caused tho Irish to call Aldfiid the alumnus of Adamnang, and which proved so

d His reiyn.—The Irish Life of St. Adamnan tells
the following curious story of this king’s interment:
⁴* The body of Bruide, son of Bne, king of the
Cruthnigh, was brought to Ia, aud his death was
sorrowful and grievous to Adamuan, and he de-
sired that thc body of Bruide should he brought to
him into the house that night. Adamnan watched
by the body till morning. Next day, when the
body began to move and open its eyes, a certain
pious man came to the door of the house, and said,
If Adamnan's object be to raiae the dead, I say he
should not do so, sor it will be a degradation to every
cleric who shall succeed to his place, if he too can-
not raise the dead. There is somewhat of right in
that, replied Adamnan. Theret'ore, as itis more
proper, let us give our blessing to the body and to
the soul os Bruide. Then Bruide resigned his spirit
to heaven again, with the blessing of Adamnan and
the congregation of Ia. Then Adamnan said-

Mnny wonders doth he perform,-

The king who was bom of Mary.

He takes away life.

penetratiou and candour, he was unable to shake off
entirely the ohl national infatuation about Scotia.

See the passage cited at p. 186, infra. And again:
¹¹ The names Scotia and Hibernia, which in these
times were indifferently applied, by the writerS, to
Ireland and Scossandss' and, ‘⁴ his adding ἰπ Hibernia
is the effect of the confusion of this name, applied
sometimes, as Ι said, in ancient times, aa well
to the northern part os Britain, inhabited by the
Scots, as to Ireland, properly so called '¹ (Civ. Eccl.
Hist. pp. 292, 293). Goodall says that Ireland was
not known tili after Vespasian‘s time, and that the
