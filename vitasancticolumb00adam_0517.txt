The passage here cited is the parting mention of Hy in the Irish Annals² and as it
closes a long list of notiees, running* through nearly seven ecntun‘es, it leaves the
island as it found it, in the hands of Irish ecclesiasties, an important outpost of the
Irish Chureh, a centre of uniou between provinces whose people were of one blood, and
who were enrolled under one name in the list of nations, ffll the accident of time
limited to one the common name of both, and the accident of place created separate,
and sometimes rival interests.

Tfln island of Hy, vulgarly called Iona⁸‚ lies off the Ross of Mun 011 the south-

west, being separated from it by a channel about an English mile bro-adh, called by
1173; and Amblaibh, bishop of Armagh‚ and son of set-off, in making Sodor a localized Soter. A

the former, died in 1185. This Ainmire became learned Briton, on the other hand, tells us of “ Hu

abbot of Derry when Awley O'Freel was promoted
to Hy, and he died in 1213.

¹ lona—The simplicity of the original name is
indicated in the old legend referred to at p. 53,
supra ,· and the ancient forms in which it is found
are treated ofin pp. 258-262. The conjecture ex-
pressed at p. 261, that Colgan had, on his own au-
thority, printed Iona instead of Iona iu the shorter
Latin lives, is confirmed by a recent examination os
the Codex Salmanticensis which the present writer
was enabled to make. It contains the original of
Vita Secunda in Colgau‘s collection, and invariably
exhibits the name iona. So that what Abp. Ussher
observes concerning Cauisius and Messingham, “ab
Adamuani editoribus passim lova mendose exarata
legitur'⁷ (Wks. vol. vi. p. 239) is not borne out.
The etymological ordeal that this corrupt word,
Iona, has gone through, certainly has not tended to
reduce it to its original integrity. Fordun, reading
Adamnan's adjective iona as iona, aud full ofAdam—
nan's Scripture equivalent for Columba (5), imper-
senates the island, ¹* insula 1. vel Iona Hebraice,
quod Latine Columba” (261), and thus introduces
the Hebrew element into Scottish topography. Yet
this appeared very reasonable to Keith (Bps. p. 294,
ed. 1824), aud Pennunt (Tour, vol. iii. p. 243, ed.
1774), the former of whom, however, gives a Greek

vel Hui, atque altero etiam nomine Iona, composito
scilicet vocabulo de Ibernorum I atque Pictorum
Onus, quorum utrumque Insulam significa& (Bax-
ter, Glossar. Antiqq. Brit. voce Sodorinas). Would
that we possessed his Pictish Dictionkry! Celtic
etymology, again, takes a more funciful ssight: the
natives told Martin the Voyager, cire. 1700, ot* their
tradition “that one of the Clergy-Men who accom-
panied columbus in his Voyage thither, having at
a good distance espied the Isle, and cry'd joyfully
to Columbus in the Irish language, Clu· mi ἰ, i. ev I
see her; meaning thereby, the Countrey of which
they had been in quest. That Columbus then an-
swer'd, it shall be from henceforth called F* (West.
Islds. p. 2 56). The Rev. Dugal Campbell tells us
“Bede calls it Hii, but the proper name is I, which
So far he is
nearly right, but he goes on, “Bede's miseake pro-
ceeded from his ignorance of the Gaelic. In
monkish writers, it is called Iona, which signifies
the Island ofWaves, and he adds in the note, “Iona
is, in Gaelic, spelt I-thonn3 but as the tlt is not
sounded, Latin writers spen it Iona. The name is
very characteristic of it in times of storm'· (Old Stat.
Acct. vol. xiv. p. 198). His successor, the Rev.
Douald Cam pbess, assents to this etymolog-y as good,
so that the Tourist's Guide could do no less than

in the Gaelic signifies an island.“
