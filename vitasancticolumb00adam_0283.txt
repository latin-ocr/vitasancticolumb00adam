Itinerar. Cambr. ii. 1.) The first appearance of
this disease in lreland is stated by Tighernach
to have been in the year 550; and in Britain,
by the Annales Cambriae, at 547. However,

isthe Life of St. Deelan be entitled to credit, it
was previously experienced in the former king-
d0m; for it is related that in the lifetime of
that saint, “dira pestis venitin Momoniam;
sed venenosior erat in civitate Cassel, quam in
ceteris locis; quae flavos primitus faciebat ho-
minos, et postea oceidebat.'' (Act. SS. Jul.
tom. v. p. 602 b.) The second recorded visita.-
tion of the island by the disease was the most
severe, when, during the abbotship of Cuimine
Ailbe, in the year-664„ Adamnan being then forty
'years ofage, as Bede relates, “ subita pestilen-
tiae lues, depopulatis prius australibus Brittaniae
plagis, Nordanhymbrorum quoque provinciam
corripiens, atque acerba clade diutius longe
lateque desaeviens. magnam hominum multi-
tudinem stravit. Haec autem plaga Hiberniam
quoque insulam pari clade premebat.'¹ (H. E.
iii. 27.) Tighernach records its appearance
in 664 in these words: Tenebroe [i. e. Eclipsis
solis] in Calendis ΖῑῙαίί in hora nona, et in eadem
estate celum ardere visum est. Mortalitas maqna
in Hiberniam pervenit in Calendis Auqush, ἱ. e.
in Maylz Ilha in Layenz'a. Ee terroe motus in
Britannia. In campo [th in Fochairt exarsit
niortnlitas primo in Hibernia, a morte Patr-lcii
cciii. Prima mortalitas cxii. These computa-
tiens, it is to be observed, go back to the death
of sen-Patrick. Under the following year, the
Annalist adds: Abbaeesque Reyesque innumera-
biles mortui fuerant. With him agree the no-
tices in the An. L'lt. at 663, 664, 666. iu which

the continued prevalence of the mortality is
recorded. At 667, it was still raging, sor they
have the entry, Mortalitas magma Buidhe Co-
nnill. After this the disease appears to have
abated for a time; but it soon after broke out
with renewed violence. The Annals of lnis-
fallen, at 671, which is 683 of the common era.
notice the Initium ter-tice mortalitati's; and the
Ann. Cambr. (683) record ‘⁴ Mortalitas in Hiber-
nia‚” with which agrees the Brut y Tywysogion
at the same date3 while at 682 they tell us.
“Mortalitas magna fuit in Britannia in qua
Catgualart filius Catguolaum obiiw (Monum.
Hist. Brit. pp. 833, 841.) The Ann. Ult„ at
682, have, Initium mortalitatis puerorum in
mense Octobris; and again, in the following
year, Mortalitas parvulorum. The Four Mast.
at ⁶84 record, “A mortality upon all animals
in general, throughout the whole world, for
the space of three years, so that there escaped
not one out of the thousand of any kind of ani-
mals.'' Which Florence of Worcester. at 685,
describes as “Magna pestilentiae procella, Bri-
tanniam corripienS‚ lata nece vastavit.'' (Mo-
num. p. 537.) The existence of the scourge in
England at 680 may be gathered from Bede
(H. Ε. ἰν. 7, 14); and at 686, from his Historia
Abb. Wiremuth (c, 8). From the date of its
appearance in 664, to the commencement of
the following century, the Irish Annals record
a continued train of portents and calamities;
thus affording evidence of the sufferings and
terrors experienced during this period.
