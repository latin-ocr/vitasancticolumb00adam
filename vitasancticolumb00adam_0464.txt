360 Additional Notas. [N.

Within the enelosure was a plateolaq (203), or ponbehe (98 m), surrounding or be-
side which were the Lodgings, hospitia, of the community. They appear to have been
detached huts, originally formed of wattles (106), or of wood (177). Ex-

Hospttia. terna] authorities call them boehm, celloe³, cellulaet. Adamnan makes
frequent mention of the abbot's domus (22 3, 226), or hospitium (2 39), or

hospitiolum (226, 233), which he styles a tugurium (233), or tuquriolum (54, 65, 125,
215), at some distance from the others (226), built with joistsu (54), and situate on an
eminenee (227). Here the founder sat and wrote (125, 143, 215), 01· read (163), hav-

term to one volume embracing several books, which
afterwards came into general use (see Maitland's Dark
Ages, p. 194, Lond. 18 5 3), as for instance in Scot-
land, where the little library of St. Servanus's isle,
on Loehleven, numbered among its 16 volumes a
pars Bibliothecae, or ‘portion of a Bible,’ a term not
5ο vague as might be supposed (Reg. Priorat. S. An-
dreae, Pref. p. xva). The Irish acceptation of the
word was still more limited, aud they applied it to
the case or cover osa sinyle book, and, secondly,to any
case.

Again, “ Fons vero

tiones, quasi vestigium regale, et dixerunt increduli
quod quidam profeta mortuus fecit bibliotmcam sibi
in aqna sub petra ut dealbaret ossa sua” (ib. rol.
¹3 bb). Ῑο 1110 short chax-ter of ¹004 entered in this
manuscript, we find “ Sic reperi 111 bibliothicis Scoto-
rum'‘ (fol. 16 bb). St. Dega's Life gives an enume-
ration of his works, namely⁷ campanas, cymbala,
baculos'cruces, scrinia, capsas, pyxides, calices, dis-
cos, altariola, cluysmalia, librorumque coopmoria,
quaedam vero alia auro atque argento, gemmisque
pretiosis circumtecta,n (Act. SS. Aug. tom. iii,
p. 659 a.) Elsewhere in the same Life we have the
Latin equivalent for the Greek compound: “Evan-
gelium etiam optimum postremo scripsit, necnon
repositorium ad idem recondendum mirabiliter 000-
51101111.υ (Ib. p. 659 b.)

a Plateola —Tbe Irish term polede denotes ⁴ a
green,’ ‘aecum' or the entrenched space attached

to an earthen fort. Faheeran in the ang's Connty
is poiece Cianum, platea Kiaranz‘ (Four 111851Π
1547). Cormac’s Glossary translates pulcer by

platea, voc, plu. (Ir. Neunius, p. 93.)

τ Borma—The Irish Life applies this term to the
cells in St. Mobi's monastery of Glasnevin.

⁵ Cema—St. Cainnech was 00 000 occasion in
Hy, and when the bell tang for nona the abbot was
missing, and “per 01111105 cellas ab omnibus fratribus
diligenter quaerebatm.” Vit. c. 22 (p. 40, ed. Orm.)
Colgan's Ter-t. rit. speaks of the abbot‘s cella, 0. 34
(Tr. Th. p. 329 b).

¹ Cenum—The Sec. Vit. 10 Colgan has “tunc 0

omnes fratres de suis advenientes cellulis, cap. 19
(Tr. Th. p. 327 α). Bede's description of st. Cuth-
bert's monastery where there were only oratorium
and habitaculum commune (Η. Ε. iv. 28), was of a
different character: but his account of the casce and
domunculae of Coldingham (Η. Ε. iv. 25) applies to
the monastery of Hy. In fact the Irish monasterias
seem to have been modelled very much after the
eastern pattem, such as Adamnau describes of the
monastery of Mount Thabor: “ Cujus in medio
campo monachorum inest grande monasterium, et
plurimae eorumdem cenulae.’' And again, “Supra
memorati monasterii et trium ecclesiarum aedifieia
curn cellulis monachorum, lapideo omnia circumve-
niuntur muso''-—-ii. 27 (Mabill. Act. SS. Ord. Ben.
saec. iii. pt. ii. p. 467). Cassula is used for cellula
in the Book of Armagh (fol. 5 ba, 10 aa).

“ him—Probably two stories high. Adamnan,
describing the abodes os the Egyptians in the flooded
plains of the Nile, says, “in domibus transversis
tabulis suffultis, aquas supra inhabitant.·’ De Locis
Sanctis, ii. 30.
