2. St. lllary’s Charch, commonly called the Cathedral, and in Gaclic, Eaelus Mor.
It 15 an edifioe of the early part of the thirteenth century, consisting of nave, transepts,
and choir, with saeristy on north side of ohoir, and side chapels on the south. The
capitals of some of the columns exhibit bas-relicfs similar to many found in Ireland.
The inscription on the capital of a column under the tower has been already alluded
to. In Graham's Iona are good views of the East and lVest Fronts (plates 30, 31),
and drawings of the bas-reliefs (plates 40-42). Adjoining the Cathedral, on the north,
are the ruins of the conventual buildings, of which the portion called the chapter-house
15 thc most ancient and remarkable. Over it is said to have been the hbraryk. See
the plate in Graham’s Iona (No. 38). Near the west entrance, seemingly beside the
adjacent angle of the cloister, was a small chamber, called St. Golamb’s Tomb‘.

3. The iWnnergs, arenerable pile, much dilapidated, but still retaining the evidence
of former elegancc. See Mnir's lucid description (Eccles. Notos, p. 5). There is no

record of its foundation, and the first writer who mentions it is Fordun (Scotichr. ii. 10). .· .

The Macdonald MS„ apparently borrowing from an earlier authority, states that Beatrix„
only daughter of Sommerled (qui ob. 1164), was prioress of Ieollumkill (collectan.
p. 287). This indicates the existence of a nunncry in the island circ. 1200.

4. Tempul Ronaln, the parish 011111011, first mentioned A. D. 1561, 111 the Rental¹³¹ of
the Bishopric, where is an entiy of “the teindis of Ecolmkill callit the personaige of
Tempill-Ronaige.’' Its situation is shown by the following references : ‘⁴ About quarter
of a Mile further South [that is, of the Reilig Orain] is the Church Ronad, in which
several Prior-esses are buried'' (Martin, p. 262). “The Nunnery Church is quite en-
tirc; one end of it is arched, and is very beautiful. Here also stands, what was called
the parish chureh. It is yet [A. D. 1795] entire, but tottering'’ (Old Stat. Ac. xiv,
p. 202). What is now considered the pai-ish chureh is the building, about the size of
0ran⁷s chapel, on the N. E. of the Nunnery, inside its enclosure. The patron saint
was probably the St. Ronanu, commemorated at St. Ronan's of Ness, in Lewis, and from

λ Library.-Martin, p. 2 58 ; Pennant, iii. p. 2 54.

¹ Tema-This must be a vulgar error. The
saint's grave would hardly be apart from the chief
cemetery (317).

¹¹ Bonam—The Scotch calendar has two of this
name, one at Feb. 7, of whom Adam Κίος says:
⁴¹S. Bonane bischop in scotland and confess vnder
king malduiue‘' (Gamla), and who, though not no-
ticed in the Calendar οἰ the Brev. Aberd.‚ is men-
tioned in the Propr. SS. of Febr. as “Episcopus
apud Kilmarouen in Livenax'' (Part. Hyem. fol.
54 ba). He, and not Mamock, or Conan, (as in

Orig. Par. vol. i. pp. 347 503) is the patron saint
of Kilmaronoek, on the east of Loch Lomond, in
Dumbartonshire. This saint may or may not be
the ⁴⁴ Ronan, natione quidem Scottus” of Bede (H. E.
iiiv 25), whom the editor of the Orig. Paroch. makes
“a Scotchmaffl (ii. p. 296), although he had pre-
viously laid down that Scotia was Ireland (ib. p.
285). Camerarius shows what his own authority is
worth in such questions, sor he identifies the patron
of Insula Reman with Bede's Ronan⁷ who was Fi-
nan's polemical opponent⁷ circ. 652, and straight-
way places his death at 778! (Feb. 6, De Scotor.
Fortitud. p. 96.) The Irish Cal. has no Bonan at
