The Burial of the Dead was a religious office, which involved a regard to the future

as well as the present. The lively saith in the Resurrection (238) rendered it a 00051-

deration of importanee to be buried among the honoured members of the

semino. societyq (163), and as the day of 11155011111011 was regarded as the natalis

(182, 210), so the object 10 the 0110100 of a burial-place was ubi resumere

(162, 3 1 3). The body of the deceased was laid out in the cell (239), wrapped in 1111011

01011105 (ῐό), where it remained during the exequz'ae(1'b.), which lasted for three days and

m'ghts (ib), in the course of which the praises of God were sung (ib.) The body

was then borne to the grave in solemn procession, and buried with due reverenee (ib.)

a Society.—This feeling was afterwards abused,
and made not only a source of gain, but the foun-
dation of perniciouS, antichristian notions. For in-
stance, there was the tradition at Clonmacnois of a
dun cow, called Odhuyr Kyarain, which supplied
1110 whole monastery with milk: ‘⁴ Pellis itaque
ejus usque hodie honorifice in civitate saneti Kia-
rani manen miracula enim gracia Dei per illud
fiunt. Et hane graciam habuit sicut veteres sancti,
i. e. discipuli sancti KieranL nobis tradiderunt, quia
divinitus est ostensum qnod omnis homo qni mortuus
fuerit super eam, vitam eternam cum Christo possi-
demist—eod, Marsh. sol. 146 αα. This hide was
turned to better account when it became the cover of
the Leablmr na Ιι Cidhre, a manuscript of clonmac-
nois, wn'tten in the twelsth century.

¹ Psalms.-AEdan's fouowers, both adtonsi and

laici, employed themselves aut leyendis Seriptwis,
aut Psalmis discendis. Bede, H. E. iii. 5.

⁵ Ecclesiasticarum.—Bede, Η. Ε. v. 18. Bede
earefully distinguishes the Sanctoe or Divinoe Scrip-
turoe (H. E. iv. 23, v. 18), from scripturoe simply
(v. 18, 20, 21). The former he styles majora studia.

2 Lanyuayes.—Ceolffid⁷s Latin epistle was trans—
lated into Pictish (Beda, H. E. v. 21). Albinus,
who was a pupil of Theodoro, circ. 7 1ο, “ in tantum
studiis scripturarum institutus est, ut Graecam qni-
dem linguam non parva ex parte, Latinam vero non
minus quam Anglorum, quae sibi naturalis est, no-
verit'' (H. E. v. 20). Of classical manuscripts be-
longing to the Irish school, it will suffice to men-
tion two: the one of Horace, “ Codex Beruensis,
N. 363, 40, saee. viii. exeuntis, vel. ix. ineuntis.
Sentice scriptus, antiquissimus omnium quotquot
