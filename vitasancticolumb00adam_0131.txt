derived that name from the Pin Οοῐὴηαηη,
Viri Dumnonii, a section of the Firbolgs. See
Keating's Hsstory, vol. i. pp. 188, 190; also
compare pp. 132, 144. 168, 368, 398. (Ed.
Haliday.) Inbher Domnouu, the old name of
the mouth of the Malahide river, near Dublin,
now disguised in Bluldowney. was derived from
the same source. The word Ιοῐηηηἱ orlppur·
signifies ‘a promontory,' andis applied, simply,
or in composition, to many places on the coasts
of Galway, Kerry‚ and Donegal. See Hardi-

church of Drumcliff is about four miles north
of Sligo, so that the districtiu which the battle
was fought is determined, though the name i<
locally forgotten. The circumstances os the
battle are thus recorded by Tighernach:
