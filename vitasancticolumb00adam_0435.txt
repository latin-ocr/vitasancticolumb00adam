pljne varied in intensity with the tempers or ascetic habits of the finmorsb. They
agreed, however, in their preference of the presbyterate; their observant-o of the old-
fashioned Easter3 the anterior Eastern tonsure; and seelusion stom female society. It
is a remarkable fact that many of the monastic ehurches, which grew in after times to
be bishops' sees, were founded by presbyters : Clonard, by Finm'an3 Clonmacnois, by
Ciaran; Clonfert, by Brendan, Aghab0‚ by Cainnech; Glendaloch‚ by Kerin3 Lis-
more, by Cartha0h3 and Derry, Raphoe, and Hy, by Columba. The great promoters
of the conventuali system sought no higher order than such as would enable them, eon-
sistently with the vows of humility, to administer the sacraments, and conduct the
ordinary devotions of their fratemities. The abbatial office gave them all the juris-
diction of the episcopate, without its responsibih'ties; and little more was left to the
bishop than the essence of his office, the transmission of holy orders, with the personal
reverence which was due to the holder of so important a commission. Another element
in the Irish monastic system was its soeial eonnexions. Erery great monastery was a
centre of family relation, and served as a school or asylum for all who were of patron's
or founder’s kin. This particular was most strikingly exemplified in the case of Hy,
as may be seen in the genealogica] table of the early abbots annexed to this note, which
shows that the abbacy was, with one or two exceptionS, strictly limited to a braneh of
the Tir-Conalh'an family. It shows, also, that there was no lineal succession in Hy,
as there was in many other Irish monasteries, where seoular interests so far prex-{tiled
as to make the abbacy hereditary⁰‚ and ultimately to frustrate the founder’s intention

b Frumers.—The personal austerities which are
attributed to some of the Irish saints are almost in-
credible. The Life of Comgall relates that that
saint, having retired to Custodiaria Insula (called
in the Calendar Ῑηη- Οοιῐὴθεῡα, now Ely Island)
in Lough Eme, ⁴⁴ monachi sui post eum in illam in-
sulam intraverunt3 et non valentes rigidissime vi-
vere, sicut suus Abbas, septem ex eis fame et frigore
mortui sunt-''—cap. 12 (Flem. Collect. p. 305 a).
The Life of St. Cainnech represents him as travelling
“trans Dorsum Britannice? and states that “Sancti
Hybemieuses miserunt nuncios post Sanctum Cain-
nicum audientes eum hei-emitum esse in Britannia, ct
tunc ductus est sauctus Cainnicus de heremo contra
suam voluntatens (Vita, pp. 13, 39, ed. Ormonde).

⁰ Hereditary.—The Book of Armagh gives us a
most vaiuable insight into tho ancient economy of
the Irish monasteries in its account of the endow-
ment of Trim. In that church there was an Eccle-
siastica proqenies and a Flebilis proqenies. a reli-
gious and secular succession: the former, of office.
in spirituals; the latter, of blood, in temporals;
and both ‹lescended from the original grantor. In
the religious succession eight names are mentioned,
and it is added, “Hi omnes episcopi fuerunt et
principes'⁷ [abbots]; in the lineal succession there
are nine names in a descending pedigree⁷ and it was
from this line that the ecclesiastica proqenies was
from time to time supplied (fol. 16 bb). The lineal
transmission of the abbatia} office, which appears in
the Irish Annals towards the close of the eighth
century, probably had its origin in the usurpation
hythe plebilis proyenies connected with the various
monasteries of the functions of the ecclesiastica pro-
qem'es. which would be the necessary result of the
