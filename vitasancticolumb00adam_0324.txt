22 4 Vita Sancti Columbae [ma. ιιι.

in quadam exedrae, quae oratorii adhaerebat parieti, devotus orabat. Et post
aliquantum quasi horae intervallum unius, vir venerandus Columba eandem
sacram ingreditur domum, simulque cum eo aurea lux, de summa coeli altitu-
dine descendens, totum illud ecclesiae spatium ⁹replens. Sed et illius exedriolae
separatum conclave, ubi se ¹⁰Vi1·gnous‘³‚in quantum potuit, latitare conabatur,
¹¹ejusdem coelestis claritas luminis, per interiorem illius cubiculi januam, quae
ex minori patebat parte, erumpens, non sine aliquo formidabili repleverat ter-
rore. Et sieut nullus 1²aesteum et ¹³1neridianum solem rectis et irreverberatis
potest intueri oeulis, sic et illam coelestem claritudinem ille ¹⁴Virgnous, qui vi-
derat, sustinere nullo poterat modo3 quia valde oculorum ¹⁵reverberabat aciem

memoirs were written by Adamnan during his
presidency over Hy, that is, between 679 and
704. He writes in the first person also in i. 1
(p. 16), 49 (p. 95), supra, cap. 23, infra. The
titulus being omitted in the Bollandists, the
words supra memoratus which refer to it are
without meaning in their edition.

¹* Exedra.—Further on we meet with the di-
minutive exedriolae separatum conclave. The
term, which is borrowed from Cummian, de-
notes a small chamber, or chapel, attached to
the side ofa church. It was probably the name
uf an apartment formed in the same manner as
Aidan's lodging under the opposta or destina
ofhis church outside. (Bede. H. E. iii. 17‹) The
lrish word θγιῡοιη is employed in a similar
sense. See Petrie's Round Towers, pp.432-438.
The exedra is called cubiculum lower down.
Adamnan uses the word exedra in his tract De
Locis Sanctis also, where speaking ofthe church
ou Calvary he says z ‘⁴ quaedam inest exedra in
qua est calix Domini.'¹-i. 8 (Mabsslon, Act. SS·
ι). Bened. Saec. iii. p. 461). See Valesius on
Euseb. Vit.C0nstant. iii.50, p. 2081> (Par. 1678);
Biugham, orig. Eccles. libr viii. c. 7, ξ 1.

nouus, as well as Virynous, in cap. 23. infra.
Cummian, in the parallel passage (Mabillou‘s
text), reads Fernaus; but in Colgan's‚ which is
corrupt, Serranus (Tr. Th. p. 322 b, e. 15).
This was Fergna Brit, afterwards fourth ab-
bot of Hyv ⁶05—623- His day in the Calendar
is March 2. Ρίῐιδηα bmrr- mue Pmtbe

(1⁰. Di. 622. ‘Fergna Britt, son of Falbhe,
was bishop and abbot of Ia Colaim Cille, and
he was of the race of Conall Gulban, son of
Niall. A.D.622.'—Calend.Dungall. Tighern-
ach has his obit at 623, the true year, the An.
Ult. at 622‚ and An. Inisfall. at 616; but none
of thern makes mention of his being a bishop.
The Four Masters. at 622, state: ‘⁴ St. Feargna
Brit, abbot of Ia, and a bishop, died on the
second day of March.” The earliest authority
for calling him bishop is the gloss on Marian
Gorman's Festology, which has Psnccno bruc

¹ Fergna Brit, abbot of la-columki11e‚ and
bishop also.¹—Mar. 2. He was descended
from Enna Boghaine, son of Conall Gulban,
who gave name to ὸοδοῐηιδ, now Banayh, a
barony in the west of Donegal.
