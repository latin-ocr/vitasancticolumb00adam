was in Colgan’s possession; but he has done no
more than make a few allusions to it, which is
the less to be regretted as the document is for-
tunately preserved at Brussels, Burgund. Libr.
No. 2324. He states that the acts were intituJed
Cain Adhamnai71‚2that 15, Canens of Adamnan
(Act. SS. p. 382), from which it is probable that
they were the same as the eight Canons bear-
ing Adamnan’s name which have been printed
by Martene (Thesaur. Nov. Anecd. tom. iv.
col. 18), and are also in a MS. in Marsh's Li—
brary, Dublin, called Precedents of the See of
Armagh (p. 395), where they are intituled
Cunones Adomnani, into which they were 00-
pied from a MS. of Sir R. Cotton. Of the sub-
scribing members Colgan has preserved the
following names :-—-1. Aidus, Episcopus Slep—
tensis (Tr. Th. p. 218 a). 2. Colga filius
Moenaigh, Abbas Luscanensis (Act. SS. p
382). 3. Mosacer, Abbas (ΙΙ). 045411). 4. Κ11-
lenus filius Lubnei, Abbas Sagirensis (lb. p.
473 b). 5. Mochonna, Antistes Dorensis (lb.
p. 566 a; Tr. Th. p. 503 a). 6. Echemus, An-
glus (Act. SS. p. 604 a). These acts were not

dated, and though Colgan generally assigns
them to the year 695, he is undecided between

it and 694, 696, or 697. The topographical
history of Tara Hill also records 3. synod at
which Adamnan presided. Close to the wall
of Tara ehurchyard, on the west, are the
traces of an earthen enclosure anciently called
the Ros: no Senot), ⁴ Rath of the Synods.¹
within which the Dinnseanchus places the

Tent of Adamnan' (Petrie’s Tara, pp. 115,
151). Here, according to 30 ancient poem,

Irgalach, surnamed Ua Conaing, seems to have
been 3. ueighbouring chief. He is mentioned
by Tighernach at 701: and at 70² he was
slain on Inisfflaic-Nesan by the Britons. (Ann.
Ult. 701.) It may have been on this occasion
that Adamnan procui-ed the enactment of a
law prohibiting women from taking part in
saction fights, which was called, from him, the
Com (1000111010, ⁴ Law of Adamnan‚' 0011 no

which probably reference is had in the entry ot·

institution of this law than the following, which
is taken srom the Leabhar Brezxc, and Book 01
Lecan: ‘⁴ Adamnan happened to be travelling
one day through the plain of Bregia with his
mother on his back, when they saw two armies
engaged in mutual conflict. lt happened then
that Rouait, the mother of Adamnan, ohserved
a woman, with an iron reaping-hook in her
hand. dragging another woman out of the op-
posite 1131131100 with the hook sastened in one
of her breasts. For men and women went
equally to battle at that time. After this Ro-
nait sat down, and said, Thou shalt not take
me from this spot until thou exemptest women
for ever from being in this condition, and from
excursions and hostings. Adamnan then pro-
mised that thing. There happened afterwards
a convention [mopooil] in lreland, and Adam-
nan, with the principal part of the clergy (11·
Ireland, went to that assembly, and he ex>

147.) It is possible also that Adamnau, in his
exertions to promote the observanee of the
