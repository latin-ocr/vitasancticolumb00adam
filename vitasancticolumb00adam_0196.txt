small semicircular plafform, formed by an ex-
pansion of the hill. On the north-east is a well,
and on the south-east is the entrance to the fort,
5 feet wide, ascending abruptly by rude steps.
On the north-east was also a long gassery,
formed against the side of the apex by large
stones regularly laid, with an inclination in-
wards‚ and covered with cross flags, similar to
the cyclopean structure of the Grianan Aileeh
(Ord. Mem. Templemore, pp. 2 17-22 1), 40 feet
long, by 2 broad, serving as a covered way, and
also as breast-work on the accessible side. The
whole orest of the hill was enclosed by a cyclo-
pean wall, of which some traces remain, though
the mass of it has been precipitated down the
sides, and either carried away for building pur-
poses elsewhere, or suffered to lie in debris at
the foot. The remarkable gallery which has
been just mentioned was disturbed and reduced
to its present condition, which is little better
than a great ridge of dry stones‚ by a person
who, about thirty years ago, brought a number
of meu to the spot ‘⁴ to search the cove for
money,’' and, with them, a bam-el of beer to
stimulate their exertions. In the Ord. Survey
the hill is placed 111 the townland Sconce, which
is a modern denomination. (Sheet 7, east
edge.) Properly, three townlands meet at the
spot, now called Lenagarron‚ Belgarra, and
Knoeknamult, and eomprehended in Leuuagor-
ran and Knoekmult, in the Londonderry Char-
ter. (Concise View of the Irish Soc. Append.,

629. The Annals of Ulster, at 628, have the
following record of it: Bellum Duin Ceitlzirnn

Hy Neill there existed a hostile feeling from the
time of the battle of Mein-doira, mentIOned at
cap. 7. Aedh Dubh, lord of the former, in
565, slew Diarmait (see cap. 36). In the year
preceding the present engagement, Congal
Caech, or Claen, Kiug of Uladh. slew Suibhne
Meaun, monarch of Ireland, who was of the
Cenel Eoghaiu branch of the northern Hy Nein,
and thus made room sor the accession of Domh-
nall, as predicted in chap. 10, supra„ who
avenged his kinsman's death in the manner re-
lated in the text. For Congal Claeu's move-
ments after this battle, see the note on Bellum
Roth, iii. 5, infra.

that he was iu his fifth year at the date of the
battle. He speaks in the first person also 111

¹¹1 Finanus.—0f the nine saints of this name
in the calendar, Colgan supposes him to be the
Finan Lobhar of Mar. 16. (Act. SS. p. 627.)
O'Dounell, upon what authority is uncertain,
says of him: “ S. Finnen qui in monasterio de
Mayh-Cosyain anachoreticam vitam diu trans-
duxiffl-i. 95. (ΤΡ. Τ11. 404 b.) That place
is now called Macosquin. See note on cambas.

⁰ Cambas.—This monastery was founded by
S. Comgall, probably under the patronage of
the Pictish residents in Dun-da-bheann or
Mountsandal, and Dun-Ceithern, whose oc-
cupation of this territory is still attested by
the townland ofDrumcroon‚ or ¹ Picts Ridge,' in
the same parish, and Duncroon, 01· ‘ Picts Fort7'
