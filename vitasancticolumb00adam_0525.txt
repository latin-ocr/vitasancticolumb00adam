has subsequently published a drawing of the west face also.

z. Maclean's Crosa. On the waysidey proceeding from the N unnery towards the
Cathedral. The shaft is 10 feet 4inchcs high. Its name is plainly a vulgar misnomer.
See the drawing in Graham's Iona (Pl. 43).

3. St. John’s Crass, of which only a portion remains, stood in the Cathcdral ground
north of St. Martin‘s. Graham gives a drawing (Pl. 40). “ In a field upon the west
side of the chureh, there is a cross which appears to be of very ancient date. It is of
one stone, near eight feet high, and twenty inches broad, set on a pedestal of granite’'
(New Stat. Acet. vii. pt. 2, p. 335).

Chrossaz'm bears this name, although the object which gave occasion to it 15 gone.

6. St. Brandon's Crosa, stood near Tobar Orain, a little way east of the Free

8. Na Crassan Mor, ‘ The great C1·0sses‚' is the name of a spot 0111110 left of the

1. Cobhan ommim, spelt Collum Caildz‘ch, and interpreted ‘ Culdee's Cell,’ or
‘ Couch,’ in the Old Stat. Acct. (xiv. p. 200). This building, whatever it was, stood
in a hollow between Dum'i and¹ Dunbhuirg, and but faint vestiges of it now remain.
In ¹795 it is described as “the foundation of a small circular house, upon a reclining
plain. From the door of the house, a walk aseends to a small hillocky with the remains
of a wall upon cach side of the walk, which grows wider to thc hfflock. There are

Port-a-churraich, derives its name from several circles of stone foundations seattered
