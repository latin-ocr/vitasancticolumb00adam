His name is not found iu the Annals of Ulster, but it is entered in the Four Masters, at 797,
probably on the authority of Tighemach, now wanting, at that date, or of some other early re-
cord. They term him pemi'meom cocchmbe ooup abb lue, ‘choico scribe, and abbot
of Ia.' Colgan calls him Conmanus, and takes May 10 as his festival, at which day the name
of a Cormac is entered in the Calendar of Tamlacht.

He was sui-named Dalm Daiyhre, ⁴ Alumnus DaigrL' and was appointed successor to Cellach
at Reus, in 814„ when the latter retii-ed, it would seem, to Hy. As Kells had now risen into
importance‚ and Hy had deelined, the chief of the order began to assume an official rather than a
local title, and to be styled Coarb ⁰f columcille. The year of this Diarmait‘s death is not re-
corded, nor does his name appear in the Calendar. During his presldency, probably while he
abode in Ireland, occurred a second massacre of the congregation of Hy by the Danes. On this
occasion Blaithrnac, who seems to have been superior of the monastery, was put to death. WVala-
