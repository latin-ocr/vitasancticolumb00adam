Ireland. This, however, is a conclusion drawn from unsound premises, for it supposes,

as some 111511 accounts have done, that Adamnan quarrelled with 1115 people; also that
the Irish Columbians yielded, while the Hyensian ones held out. The one supposes
Adamnan to have been expelled from hjs pastoral charge ; the other is contradicted by
Bede. The Life itself bears the fullest interna] evidence that it was written by a
member of the society, who speaks of nostrum monasterium (pp. 58, 7z, 177), living in
the island, nostra insula (12, 178), which was small and remote (241), among other
islands (185), and called Eua insula (176, 181).

Connected with the Journey to Ireland in 697, the Annals record a transaction
which they despatch with enigmatical brevity: Dedit Zeyem innocentium? populis. In
which words they allude to a social reformation which was brought about by Adam-
nan, and which, having obtained tho highest sanction of the people, became, as in the
case of many modern Acts of Parliament, associated with the name of the propounder.
A synod was convened at Tarm, within an enclosure called the Rath-nmSenadh, or
“ Rath of the Synods,'' where the memory of the chief actor was perpetuated in the
name Pupam Adhamhnaln, or “ Pavilion of Adamnan‚'’ which was given to a portion
of the space; also in the Szcae'dhe Adhamhwain, or “Adamnan's chair;'’ the Dumha
Adhamlmm'u, or “Adamnan's mound;'' and the Oros Adhamhnaffl, or “Adamnan's
cross,” situated on the east of the Ratha. This mopofflL, or ί00111101111011-80110101,’
was held, as the semi-legendary records state, at the instance of Adamnan, for the
purpose of procuring a national enactment, exempting women from war and expedi-
tions. The legend concerning the influence and circumstances which brought Adam-
nan to interfere in the matter may be seen at p. 179 of this work. The acts of the
convention were copied by Michael O’Clery from the Book of Raphoeb, and are pre-
served in 0110 of the Irish manuscripts at Brusselsss. There were present thirty-nine
ecclesiastics, presided over by F lanu Febhla, the Abbot of Armagh, and among them
were Ichtbrochtd, or Ecgbcrt, probably the individua] who brought the Hyensians to
paschal eonformity in 7163 and Murchu Mac U Mactenr‘, the writer of a portion of

¹ Tarm—The Irish Life of Adamuan places this
convention at the place now known as Ballyshan-
non: “ 011 another occasion when Adamnan was at
the royal meeting [ωδ-0011] of Conall and Coir-
pre, at Eas Ruaidh, making his Law, the roydamna
of the son of Ainniire, i. e., F Ianuabhra‚ son oscam-
rnascach, came„ having with him a female captive
who had killed a woman, to submit the case to
Adanman,'' Sne. Colgan conjectured that the conven-

tion was held at Derry or Raphoe See p. 178, infra.
The acts of the couvention do not state where it
was held, but it might be inferred to have been at
Leifir, near Birt, on the confines of ancient Meath

and Munster.
