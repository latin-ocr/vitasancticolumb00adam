whose son, Domhnall, king of Ailcluaithe (see
note b, p. 43, supra), died in 694. This battle
was fought in the valley of the Carron in Stir-
lingshire. At 650, is recorded the ‘ Death of
Cathasaeh, son of Domhnall Breac.' At 673.
is recorded the Juyulacio Domaz'nqairt mic
Domhnaill Bricc reyz‘s Dalriata. In 689, Mus
Cathasaiy nepotis Domlmaill Bricc, and Mors
Maelduin mic Conaill Crandamhna. On the
death of Maelduin, the royalty passed to Fer-
char Fada, of the house of Loarn, who was
able to entail the dignity 011 his descendants.

to canonize every member of the fraternity,
conjectures that this was the bishop Aidan
who was sent in 635 to convert the Northum-
brians, and died in ⁶51- But as it appears
from the narrative that the present occurrence
happened soon after 563, at which date this
Aidanus was an adult, it is not likely that he
could have undertaken the active duties of a
missionary sixty or seventy years after.
