Colum first spoke.

Thou art weleome⁰, Ο comely Comae,
From over the au-teeming sea;
What sent thee forth; where hast thou been,
Since the time we were on the same path?
Two years and a mouth to this night

Is the time thou hast been wandering from port to port.
From wave to wave : resoluto the energy.
To traverse the wide ocean!

Since the sea hath sent thee hither,
Thou shalt have fi‘iendship and counsel:
KVere it not for Clm'st’s sake, Lord of the fair world,
Thou hast merited satim and reproach.

forman—Lot there be no reproaeh now,
O descendant of Niaffl, for we are a noble mee 2
The sun shines in the west as in the east :
A righteous guest is entitled to reeeption.

(Tr. Th. p. 42¹ a) Both these poems are found
also in a MS. of the Bodleian Library, Laud. 615
(pp. 34, 107), which contains a large collection of
Irish poems, 136 in number, sor the most part as-
cribed to St.Columba. They are nearly all of a
later age, varying in their date, but aboundiug
with very curious matter. The present text is
printed from the beautiful copy made for the Rev.
Dr. Todd, from the Brussels MS.v by Mr. Eugene

Curry, to whom the Editor is iudebted for the in-
terpretation of these ancient compositions.
