Comxrmn life was considered a special militia Christi (61, 118), and they who
adopted it were looked upon as Christi milites (22, 2 36, passim), in reference to their
Lfflder, and conmilitones (77, 142, 144, 196) as regarded one another. E'ach one
professed his readiness Deo exhibere hostiam (61), by withdrawing from the cares of the
world, and awillingness to enter it only as an athleta Christi (vit. Munnae) in the pro-
pagation of the Gospel (Bede, iii. 3). The society, termed coenobialis eoetzcs (12), or
colleqium monachorum (Bede, 111. 5), consisted essentially of an Abbot and Family.

senior (2ο, 72), and, inthe founder's case, patronus (6, 19, 185, 230, 234, 239), had his
seat at the matrix eceleeia (29), which was situate in Hy, the insula primaria

churches, which either he in person (23, 59 n, 86, 99, 1 60), or his disciples (60,

66, 144), founded in Ireland (276-289) or in Seotland (289-298), which he occasionally
u'sited (2 3, 99), and regulated (50, 171), and ministered in (221), and whose respec-
tive Supefiors, praepositi (58, 59, 60, 78, 127), received their charge from him (57, 59,
86), and were subject to hjs orders, even when minister-ing in churches of their own
foundation (60, 7ο). In ecclcsiastieal rank he was a presbyter, and officiated at the altar

St. Brendan's case was precisely similar: he founded
Clonfert„ and was presbyter-abbot of it from 564
tiu his death in 577. St. Moenu, or Maeinenn. was
bishop of the same church during the founder's lise-

mal, and the abbot was occasionally distinguished
from the bishop who was his subordinate. Sce
