(lamus gave name to a. parish situate on the
westofthe Bann, in the diocese of Derry, which,
for distinction's sake, is called Comus juxta
Banu, there being another of the same name in
the Tyrone part of the diocese, styled, from
the neighbouring river, Cumas juxta Monrne.
An island in the Banu, opposite the churchyard
of Carnus, was formerly called lnip Lochssm
(Four Mast. 1170, 1544), beside which was a
shallow spot known as ρθειῃι-(ηἸ Campo, ⁴ the
Ford of Camus‚‘ from which the island is called
Enis Forsed on Speed's Map os Ulster. ln the
twelfth century an abbey was founded in ano·
ther part os the parish, called in Cistercian re-
cords De Claro Fonte (Martem, Thes. Nov.
Anecd. iv. coll. 1460, 1524), but by the Irish

transverse hands into four compartments‚ each
containing three human figures in relief, stood
on a base at the west side till 1760, when it was
overturned‚ and, having been mutilated, was
converted into a gnte-post for the churchyard.
in which condition it still exists. See Reeves'
Colton's Visitaffion, p. 83; Sampson's Snrvey
of L. Derry, p. 484. The name Conmp is sup-
posed to be eompounded of cuni-(11³, ‘ crooked
stream‚‘ and in Ireland there are twelve town-
lands ofthe name. In Scotland it is sometimes
camus, as in Argyleshire‚ and sometimes Cam-
bus, as in Lanark and Perthshire. See note on
