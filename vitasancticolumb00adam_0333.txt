There is a very curious reliquary preserved
in the O'Donnell family. called the Caah (from
coenon, proeliator), because it was anciently
borne as a. standard into battle. lt is a silver
case, containing a portion of the Latin Psaster,
traditionally reported to be in St. Columbkille's
handwrifing, and believed to be the very copy
which he made from St. Finnian's book. It
certainly is not the book here referred to, as it
contains from Psal. 31 to 106, in the same hand-
writing. See Barbam, Antiq. Res. vol.i. pp. 109-
121, and the fac-simile, p. 112.

1 Deficient omni hona—Cumanam has the
same reading as Adamnan, but the later
Lives, as those in the Cod. Salmant. (Colg.
Tr. Th. pp. 327 α, 329 b). and O'Donnell (iii.
53, p. 440 b), have substituted the reading
minuentur, which is found in the Caah also (fol.
2), though after the word bono there is this
marginal mark ἦῆ (Psal. xxxiii. 1 1 3 or xxxiv.
ιο.) On Adamnau's use of the Ante-Hierony-
mian Latin text, see Lauigan, Eecl. nist. vol.

belonged to Sunday. The office which he at-
tended was that commonly known as the Vign-
Iiae nocturum. Maugina is described in ii. 5
(p. 112)s11pr11‚ as similarly engaged. On the
use of the word missa see Ussher, u'ks. vol. iv.
p. 276. The present reading in Cod. Β. indi·
cates a modern limitation of the term.

¹² Nudam petram—In the upper apartment
of St. Columba's house at Kells “there is a
flat stone, six feet long, and one soot thick.
now called St. Columba's penitential bedf-
Petrie, Round Towers, p. 426. The Four Mast.
relate that in ¹034 Mac Nia Ua hUaehtain. lec-
tor of Ceanannus [Kells], was drowned coming
from Alba with the bed of Colum-Cill; but they
have mistaken the original in the An. Ult.

⁰ Lapidem—Thus Maguir, in his gloss on the
Feilire, as translated by Colgan, says of St. Kie-
ran of Saiger: ‘⁴ Quando aliquantulum pausa—
bat, saxum erat ipsi pulvinaris loco'' (Act. SS.
p. 471 a.) The Life os St. Kiaran of Clonmac-
