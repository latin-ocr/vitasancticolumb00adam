which it has sometimes been judged desirable to invahdate. Sir J ames Dalrymple, in
1714, when defending the Presbyterian view of Church government‘, found it eonve-
nient to throw discredit on the aneedote told 111 i. 44 (p. 85, infra), and, as a means
towards this, called the genuineness of the whole work 111 question. ‘¹ Ι cannot agree,⁷'
says Sir J ameS, “ with our Biographer¹¹‚ that the Authority of Adamnamcs is equal, far
less, preferable, to that of Beda, since it was agreed on 11]] hands to be a fabulous History,
lately published in his Name, and that he was remarkable for nothing, but that he was
the first Abbot of that Monastery‚ who quit the Scottish Institutim, and became fond
of the English Ramish Rites.’' In our own day Doctor Giles, when translating Bede's
Ecclesiastieal History, added the remmk‘: ‘¹ Resides the work ‘ On the Holy Plaees,¹
Adamnan is the reputed author of a ‘ Life of Saint Columba‚’ but 1 have strong doubts
of Adamnan‘s having written it. 1 propose shortly to publish the original text ofboth
these works.⁷' On what the writer’s seruples were founded does not appear, as the
proposed opportunity of declau'ing it has never occurred. It is to be hoped that the
doubts originated in a different style of research from that which made Bede's Colum—
aelli an islandw, and Dearmaek the same as Derry¹ 1 Lastly, in 1 851, a Prussian
clergymaffl, hoping to extend to a portion of British antiquities the enlightenment of
German criticism, objected to the Vita Adamnam' on these grounds: “ Haec ipsa adeo
fabulis est obscurata, ut vix credi possit, vii 53001110, quo literae apud Hyienses flo-
ruerunt, ejusmodi nugas esse conscriptas. Prologi autem Vitae suspicionem mihi
faciunt, quorum titulum ‘ Praefatio Apologiaque Adamnam‘ Abbatis saneti scriptoris' a
librario esse praepositum nemo non videt, apologiam vero, quae tam stylo ae sermone
quam re aliena sit a Vita ipsa, ficticiam esse, facile apparet.'’ But surely these are
not the observations of one qualified to pronounee judgment on such a question. If
nuyoe and sabuloe such as Adamnan‘s indicate spuriousness, what becomes of early
biography? As to the title of the Prologue, had he eonsulted a good editiom, he might

again, “juxta exemplar quod mihiArculfus inpagi- the translation of Beda, v. 9, and Dr. Giles cor-
nola figuravit cerata depinximus’' (i. 3). reeted it in his second edition, p. 248.
