396 a, c. 46). The monastery of Birr, so called
from the stream on which it stood. grew in
after times into a town bearing the same name,
for which Parsonstown is a modern substitute.
Birr is set down by Keating as a boundary of
ancient Meath (vol. i. p. 128, ed. Haliday). It
was formerly part of Eile O‘Carroll, in Mun-
ster, but is now at the S. W. extremity of the
King's County, in Leinster, “in ipso Hiberniae
meditullio.'' (Ussher. Wks. vi. p. 523⁴)

⁴³ &madent-Mentioned already in cap. 3
(p 193) supra. He was son of Neman and
Mannsena, and was one of the race of Corb
Aulam, great-grandson of Rudhraighe, the
founder of the Clanna Rudhraighe (O‘Flaherty,
Ogyg. p. 274). Ussher in one place (Ind.
Chron. 57 ι) erroneously calls himfilius Luaiy-
nei. but elsewhere he correotly writes ‘⁵ Neimi
sive Nemaindi clari poetae filius.'' (Wks. vi.

p. 523 ) He was sometimes called senior Brea„
danus, to distinguish him from Brendan of
Clonfert, son of Finnlogh‚ and is spoken of as
“Brandanus Biorra, qui Propheta in scholis
illis, et etiam sanctorum Hiberniensium habe-
batuam-Vin Finniani, e. ¹9 (Colg. Act. SS. p.
395 a). His acts are preserved in the Cod.
Salmant.‚ from which Colgan published the por-
tion relating to St. Columba (Tr. Th. p. 462 a.
n. 44). The date of his founding the ehurch of
Birr is not recorded, but Tighernach‚ at 559,
has this curious entry: Ascensio Brenaind in
curru suo in aerem. His death is entered in
Tighernaeh at 565 and 573 ς in the An. Ult. at
564 and 571; and in the An. Inisfall. at 565.
The later date in Tighernach seems preferable.
Ussher and the Four Mast. fix the event at 57 1.
He died on the night before the 29th of No—
vember, which is his day in the Calendar, in
the eightieth year of his age.
