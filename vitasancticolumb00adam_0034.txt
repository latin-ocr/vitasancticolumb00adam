xx Prqface.

The writing is in double columns. The pages are generally marked across
with horizontal ruled lines drawn by a sharp inst-rumcnt', and the columns are
defined by perpendicular lines of the same kind, always leaving the column on
the left narrower than that on the right. The volume is probably in the
original binding: the sides are beech-wood‚ greatly worm-eamn, covered with
calf-skin3 the sewing of the back is very rude and cnrious, and the front was
formerly secured by clasps.

A very remarkable feature of this manuscript is the copy of the Lord's
Prayer, written on the last page, if not by the same hand, at least by one of
the same age and school. It exhibits the Greek character adopted by the
Irish‚ in its mediuscular or semi-uncial state, and in orthography fully comes
up to Kuster's critiquem on the Irish MS. of the Pauline Epistles, called the
Corleae Hoerner-ianus .· ‘⁶ Librarium nactus est valde imperitum et oscitantem-’⁹
It exhibite in a marked manner the same disregard of quantity which is ob-
servable in tho Greek letters and in the Book of Armagh, and in the old
metrieal Latin of theb-ish ; as well as in the words HHPICTHPA for περισ-
τερα“, and CHKVNAVC for secundm, in the body of the manuscript. The
following represents its orthography and division in ordinary letters ε-Πατηρ

In thc 25th of St. Matthew, at the top of fol.
48 bb, there are two lines where the ink is ex-
tremely pale, probably owing to some diluent
used by the writer, for there is an error at the

common in Irish MSS. See Rettig‘s account
of the ruling of the Codex Sangallensis, Pro-
lcgom. p. x. (Turici⁷ 1836). In the Book of
Armagh the ruling of the Gospe15‚ which are
written with great delicacy, does not catch the

lines, marking out the spaces for the horizontal
lines, are very plain, especially on the first leaf

served for the whole fasciculus* There is, in

connexion with the ruling, this remarkable fea-
ture in the second part of the Book of Armagh,
that the writing lzanyssrom, instead of restiny
on, the line. This was a peculiarity of Oriental
wrifing, and was adopted by the Irish for con-
venience, inasmuch as the upper part of many
oftheir letters, as p, ὅ, p, Γ, c, coiucided better
with a horizontal line than the lower. The two
volumes of Doomsday in the Chapter House at
westminster afford a medieval illustration of
tbe marginal spaciug, and the ruling with a
pointed instrument.
