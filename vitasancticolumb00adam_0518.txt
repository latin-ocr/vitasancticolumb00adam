Adamnan fretum Iouoe insule& (54, conf. 28, 5 5, 61, 82), 111 after times named the Bay
oj‘F1'7ff02·t0‚ and now commonly known 35 the Soemd of Iona. The island lies N. E.
and S. W.‚ 15 about three miles long, and varies in breadth from a 111110 to a 111110 and
a half. The earliest reference to its extent is in Bede, who, aeoordjng to the vague
mode of calculation current in his day, says: “ Neque enim magna est, sed quasi
familiarum quinque, juxta aestimationem Anglornm” (H. E. 111. 4); that is, ν. 11Ῡῖ130,
‘ five hides of land,’ as his Saxon interpreter, and the Saxon Chroniele (An. 565), ex-
press it. Fordun (Scotiehr. 11. 1), and 0111015ΦΕ after him, represent the length as two
miles. The superficial extent is estimatedf at 2000 imperial aereS, 600 of which are
under cultivation, and the remainder, 11111 pasture, 11101355, and rocks. The surfaee is
very 1111ον011, and for the most *part eonsists of small green patches, alternat-ing with
rocky projections, which in ‘the northern half of the island are more high and eraggy,
being intersected with deep ravines, but in the southern half, where the general level
15 higher, are more 001111110115, and present to 1110 eye 311 11οᾶ111011οἕ expense of a gray,

story (Anderson’s Guide, p. 592, ed. 1850), 3 rather
formidable introduction, however, in squally wea-
ther. The author of the Antiquities of Iona, proba-
bly wishing to find a eounterpart to the Norse Eymz
Helyo‚ suggests li-shomz, ⁴ Holy Island' (but 1¹01]ss
is happy) as 1110 most likely origin of Iona. In this
he is followed by tbe writer of “Staffa and Iona De-
scribed,” who dismisses Ι-ΐῘιοπ ‘¹ as au inappropriate
epithet, expressive of no distinctive character, inas-
much as it will be difficult to point out an island in
the ocean, which is not an island of waves”! (p. 60,
ed. Blackie ἃ. Son). The true etymological story
is told by Arehdeacon Monro, in 1594, in these few
words : ⁴⁵ The ile Erische callit Lcolm-kill, that 15,
Sanct Colm's ile” (Miscell. Scot. vol. ii. p. 127).

Β Broad.—T. Innes makes the channel two miles
broad, and concludes ‘⁴ that the distance betwixt
these two islands was not so great in S. Columba's
time, since we find that passengers used to call over
the frith from M ull to Ycolmkill” (Civ. Eccl. Hist-
p. 162). But see note at p. 54, supra. Innes pro-
bably took his distance from Monro’s “Narrest 11115,

be twa myles of sea‚'⁷ his this being Eri-ay isle.

ἓ Bay ⁰f Finfhrt.—So called on Blaeu's map.
Finfort is the name of the landing-place opposite
Port Ronuiu, on the Mull side. Here is 311 ancient
burying-ground, but without any old tombstones.
It was probably, in the first instance, a corpach, or
resting-place, in foul weather, for bodies on their
way to Hy. Archdu. Monro mentions “a guid
raid sornent Colmkill, 031111, Ροῖῖαἰεεε,” but the
name is now unknown.

d Familiarum.—Bede uses the same computation
in H. E. iii. 24, bis. 25; iv. 3, 13, 16, 23; v.'19.
