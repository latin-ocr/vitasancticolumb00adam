οι· by Convallanus, according to Boece¹; or by the never-failing Druids¹¹²‚ according to
the natives, every statement that is written is perfect fiction, or, rather, imperfect fic-
tion, soritis nonsense. Columba probably found Hy unoccupied and unclaimed‚ Conall
kindly promised not to disturb him, and when the. Picts were. converted, Brudeus, the
supreme lord, of course gave to the infant institution au the right and title which the
weight of his sanction could confer.

Conall was sueceeded by his cousin Aedhan, the Aidanus of Adamnan. This
prince was the first of the Dalriadian rulers who evinced any great ability; he ex*
changed the rank of a colpech, or lord, for that of a Ῐηδ, or king, and under him it-
was that the real foundation of the Scottish monarchy was laid. He procured for him-
self a solemn inauguration, and when the monarch of Ireland, who hitherto looked upon
the Dalriads as a tributary colony, required his submission, he boldly refused to aet as
a subordinate, and at the convention of Drumceatt obtained a formal recognition of
his independence (92). The coincidence of the date of this convention in the Ann. Ult.
with the first year of Aedhan's reign is a very significant fact. He was closely con-
nected with the Strathclyde Britmm, and his wife'³ seems to have been one of that people.
Welsh writers call him Aeddan, son, by Licinn, daughter of Brychan, of Gastan ap
Dyfnwal Heu, giving him the epithet Vradog‚ or false (44). According to AEngus
the Culdee, Mathgemm, wife of Caireall, and mother of St. Mol-<lissi of Leighh'n and
Lamlash, was his daughter, who was styled, from the regal seat of the Dalriads‚
‘⁸ Maithgemni⁰ of Monadhw’ In 603 he went against king AEdilfrid, “ cum immenso

But God now revealed to Columcille that they were
not true bishops: whereupon they left the island to

true adventures?

¹ Bacca—He represents the Scotic exiles under
Maximus as taking refuge in Iona, and founding a
monastery there. See Ussher, Iud. Chr. 379.

¹¹³ Druids.—The writer in the Old Stat. Acet. is
very decided: “The Druids undoubtedly possessed
Ι, before the introduction of Christianus (xiv. p.
199). To the Highlanders of the present day Iona
is known as Innis-nan-Druidhneacb, or ⁸ Island of
the Druids' (Ncw Stat. Acct. vol. vii. pt. 2, p. 313).
⁴² It is said that the Druids had possession of Iona

before the birth of our Saviour, and that they had
there a college or school of theology, and continued
to flourish until their expulsion by columba'‘(i12.
p. 320). This is believed as firmly by the natives
as that St. Columeille existed7 and is a standing dish
for the tourists.

¹² Wifee—The Life of St. Lasreanus or Molaisi,
speaking of his birth, says: “mater ejus virtutum
meritis et nomine Gemma, Aedani regis Scotiae filia,
regisque Britanniae neptis fui& (Act. SS. April. tom.
