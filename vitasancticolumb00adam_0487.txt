races of Conaill and of Eoghan.'

F edhlimidh, who was appointed coadjutor abbut in 722, con-

tinued alive during the presidency of Cilline. Itis possible that, as Cilline was an anchorite,
the active duties of the society were discharged by his deputy.

whether this place was in Scotland or Ireland.

ἵ Monid-croib.-Moncrieffe, in the parish os
Dunbarny in Pertbshire. On the summit of Mon-
erieffe Hill are traces of an ancient circular fort.
New Stat. Account, vol. x. pv 810. Chalmers places
his Monerib in Strathern (Caled. i. p. 2 1 1). Pro-
bably it is the Dorsum Crup of the Pictish Chronicle,
which Chalmers makes Duncrub in Strathern (ib.
p. 391.) So also Pinkerton, Inquiry, vol. ii. p. 187.

1 Castellum Credi—Called Ccnplen Cpebl by
Tigheruach in the parallel place. Its situation,
aud the origin of the name, are thus given in the
Pictish Chronicle: ‘⁵ Constantinus rex et Kellachus
episcopus leges disciplinasque fidei, atque jura eccle-
siarum evangeliorumque, pariter cnm Scottis, in
Colle &redulitatis prope regali civitati Scoan devo-
verunt custodiri. Ab hoc die collis hoc nomen me-
ruit, i. e. Collis Credulitatis.''—Innes, Cn't. Ess. App.
No. iii.; Pinkerton's Inquiry, vol. i. p. 495, ii. p. 181

(ed. 18¹4)3 Chalmers, Caled. ἰ. p. 388. This was
an occurrence of circ. 9093 hence, if the statement
ab hoc die be correct, the name given in our Annals
must be a prolepsis of about 181 years. The spot
was about seventy yards north of the old abbey of
Seone, afterwards called the ,liuor-hill, now corrupted
to Boot-hill, which the Highlanders express by Tom-
a-mhoid, ⁴ hill of Justice! Old Stat. Acct. vol.
xviii. p. 863 New Stat. Acct. vol. x. p. 1065.

⁸ Pausat.—Tighernach styles him ‘Rlee ΟῙΊῚΓΕ,
miles Christi. He died, according to Bede, on
Easter Sunday, the 24th of April, 729 (H. Ε.
V. 22). Bede is followed by the Saxon Chronicle,
at 729.
