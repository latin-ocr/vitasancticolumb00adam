Roman Easter, may have attended synods of
the Irish clergy: indeed it is scarcely to be
conceived that he could otherwise have effected
such a change as Bede describes (H. E. v. 15).
But the reference in the text must be to an
earlier period of his life. {he Life of St. Gerald
states that Adamnan spent the last seven years
of his life in the presideney of the Saxon abbey
of Mayo (Colg. Act. SS. p. 602 a). This account
is open to exceptions; for it is a suspicions eir-
cumstance to find Adamnan unable, as Bede
states, to make any impression upon the Co-
lumbian communities which were subject to
him, yet cordially received in a monastery of
settlers‚ who had left their home and travelled
to a strange country, to avoid acquiescence in
that very system which their honoured visitor
was now endeavouring to promulgate. In re-
ference to the synod mentioned in the text,
Colgan (who seems to have been beside himself
at the moment) questions whether it was any
other than the Convention of Drumceatt (Tr.
Th. p. 3841)Υ n. 36)3 upon which the. Bollandist
editor observes: “ Meminisse debebat Synodum
Drumchettensem, non tempore Adamnani, sed
S. Columbae celebratam.'’ (Jun. ii. p. 226 b.)
›Plebe yeneris Loerni.—Colgan, despite of
the text, conjectures Locharna, now Larne, on
the coast of Antrim (Tr. Th. p. 384 h, n, 37);
and, for want of better information, is followed
by the Bollandists (Junii, ii. p. 226 b). Pinker-
ton, who should have known to the contrary,
fixes it *⁴111 boreali parte Hiberniae'‘ (p. 152).
O'Flaherty, however, puts the matter in its
true light: ‘¹ Quatuor in hac colonia primariae
Dalriedinorum illis fratribus oriundae sunt fa-
miliae, viz. emet ηδοῦῐιωη. Gaurani familia,
Cmel. Locum, Loarni familia, unde Lorna su<
pradicta regio in Dalrieda videtur denominata,
emet ηΟηῦυΓο, AEneae familia, et Cmel. eonn-
δοιῑῑ. Com-galli familia.'¹ (Ogyg.p.470.) This

is borrowed from the Irish tract ou the Men of
Alba preserved in the Books of Ballymote and
Mac Firbis. To the Cinel. boumn we find the
following references in the Annals of Ulster:
A. C. 677, Interfectio Generis Loairnn i Tiriun.
A. C. 718, Bellum maritimum Ardenesbi inter
Duncfzadlz rnBecc [reyem Cinntire, 720] cum
Genera Gabhrain, et Selbacum cum Genere
Loaz'rn, et versum est super Selbachum pridie
Nonas Septembris vel Octimbrz's, die vi.ferie in
quo quidam comites corruerunt. A. C. 732, Mu—
redae mac Ainfcellach reyuum Generis Loairnd
assumit. Selbach‚ tenth in descent from Loarn
Mor, who has been already mentioned as chief
of the Genus Loairn, occupied Dan Ollaiy,
now Dunolly, near Oban (An. Ult. 685, 700,
7¹3› 733), and it became the chief stronghold
of the Cinel-Loairn‚ as it continued to be of
the district of Lorn, when Mac Dougan was its
lord, and as it still is, os the representative of
that ancient brauch of the Mac Donnells. This
race of Loarn was closely allied to the founder
of Hy; St. Columba was grandson of Erca,
daughter of Loarn Mor ; and⁷ os the first twelve
abbots of Hy, nine, including Adamnan, were
descended from her. This connexion naturally

gave the community a great hold upon the re-
gard of their nearest neighbours, and rendered
Adamnan's short sojourn among them less irk-
some than it would otherwise have been. In
after times, when the raee had permanently
established themselves the word emet, or
Genus, was dropped, and their settlement
took the name simply of their founder, and
appeared in the form Lora, which, from being
a secular name, was borrowed for ecclesiasti-
cal convenience also3 and hence in the thirteenth
century we read, not only of the sheriffdom, but
of the rural deaury of Lorne (C. queS‚ Orig.
vol. ii. pt. i. pp. 91, ¹09). One of the sub-ter-
ritories of Lorn was Kinnelbatlzyn [emet boe-
