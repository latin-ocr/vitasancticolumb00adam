borrowed these lines, was of a prior date. Now as Alexander Π. reigned
from 1214 to 1249, it is evident that he cannot be intended3 Alexander I..
therefore, whose reign was from 1107 to 1124, is the subject. of the metrical
colophon.

The applicability of the 10th and 11th verses to this sovereign is eon-
firmed by F ordun‚ who, having stated the circumstances which led to the
foundation ofInch Colum by Alexander I. (p. 298, infra), addse : ‘⁶ Tum etiam
quia Sanctum Columbam semper a juventute speciali venerabatur honore ; tum
insuper, quia parentes ipsius per aliquot annos infoecundi, sobolis solatio erant
destituti, donec devotione supplici Sanctum Columbam implorantes, gloriose
consecuti sunt qnod tam anhelo desiderio diu quaesierunt.” What is even
more to the point, Fordnn‚ in the preceding chapter, says of the same king,
’ί Erat itaque in construendis ecclesiis, et reliquiis Sanctorum perquirendis,
in vestibus sacerdotalibus librisque sacris conficiendis et ordinandis studio-
sissimus.’' The reyina mentioned in the 17th verse was Alexander's queen,
Sibiflaf, who died at Loch Tay, 3 Id. Jul. 1122. Alexander-’s mother, St.
Margaret, was a great benefactor of Hyg ; and his brother had been abbot
of St. Columba’s monastery of Dunkeld. The lVillelmus of the 24th verse
was probably the wilhelmus, Bishop of the Isles‚ who, according to the Chro-
nicle ofMan¹¹‚ sueceeded Roolwer‚ and 011 whose death in 1114, Hamond‚ or
XVymund, was consecrated to the see. This would limit the composition
of these lines to the interval between Alexander’s accession in 1107, and
Bishop William’s death in 1 1 14.

The following are the principal peculiarities of this manuscript: It in-
variably calls Hy, iona insula* ,- but when in the 24th hexameter it uses
the Hebrew name of St. Columba, it writes iona .- It uses no eapitals with
proper names : It often prefixes s to initial e, as sceleritas for celerius .· lt uses
e for τε and oe: It writes περιστερά, HHPYCTHPA: It uses the adjective

generally under the days of May and June, ity for the early names under the Bishops of
and the volume seems to have been one of a the Isles, p. 296 (Edinb. 1824). The Chron-
great manuscript series of Acta Sanctorum for icon places Hamondus “ iu diebus Godredi
