within, the traces of three distinct chambers or
compartments. lt was surroundcd by a cy-
clopean cashel, the north face of which is the
most perfect, and is, in parts, nearly 8 feet
thick. This was probably “the Tower'' which
3 writer of the seventeenth century describes
as existing here (C. 1111105, Orig. Paroeh. vol. ii.
pt. 1, p. 349). Near to this, 011 the S. W„ is a

roos 1135 long fallen 111, and the walls, which are
built with cement, are reduced to the height
of about five feet. The adjacent ground is
covered with masses of large gray stones, the
debris of the walls, so that it is impossible to
examine the area where 0110 would expect to
find traces of the cemetery. lt may be that
some 011110115 sepulchral remains are locked up
there. At short distances are patches ofground
covered with gray 5101105, which appear to have
been the sites osconveutual buildings, probably
of “the Town'' mentioned by an old writer,
and of ¹* the ruins of some buildings composed
of stoue without mortar,'' which were to be
seen in 1772 (Orig. Par. ut supra). Mugsted,
recte Monkstead‚ is the name of the adjoining
farm.

within a large cemetery3 that next the bridge
much the longer of the two, and probably the
old parish church; that more remote, ofsmaller
dimensions, chiefly worthy of notice on account
ofa curious slah embedded in the floor, exhi-
biting the figure of an armed warrior. The
parish church, now known as Snizort‚ was sor-
merly styled Sanct Colm's Kirk in Snessurcl ιἰι
Troueernes (Orig. Par. ii. 1, p. 354).

111. Proceeding southwards we reach Port-
100, 1110 1111101· hay of which, N. ἲν. of the town,
was formerly called, as some old people remem-
ber, Loclz Columkille. Here, near the shore,
under the Sheriffs house. is 3 5111311 island
still called Eilean Columkille, about an eighth
osa mile in circumference at high water. lt
is nearly covered with 5101105, which were
spread upon it for the drying of sea-wrack,

Trodu by Martin (West. Isl. p. 166), lying off
the north of Kilmuir, was a chapel of St. Co-
lumba.

v. On FladdaHuna, called by MartinFladcla-
elman, which lies N. W. os last. there stood, in
1700, 3 01131101 named from St. Columba, having
on the altar a blue stone, which was supposed
