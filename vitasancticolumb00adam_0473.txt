Chronicon Hyense.

ΤΗΕ matcrials from which the following chroniclc is compiled are furnished prin-
cipally by the Irish Annals, especially those of Ulster, and they are here disposed in
such a manner as to exhibit, under each abbot, the. principa] Scottish events of his in-
· cumbency. Down to the year 800, the succession of abbots is unbroken, and the
notices of them, though meagre, are generally satisfactory; but, after that date, the
entries become irregular, and progressively defective. This is partly attributable to
the derangement of the Columbian economy caused by the Danish invasions, and the
consequent transfer of the seat of administration to Irclund. The office of abbot, in-
deed, was still maintained in Hy, but as it became subordinate to that of Coarb or Sue-

eeaesor of Columellk, whose dignity wa& to a certain extent, ambulatory among tho
Columbian houses of Ireland, the notices are desultory, and the consideration of the
local superior gradually declined, till it almost vanished t'rom the attention of the
annalist. Another marked differencc between the two periods is the constant registration
of obituary days in the former, and its almost total discontinuance. in the latter. With
two exoeptions, the festivals of the first eighteen abbots are entered in the calendars of
Marian Gorman and of Doncgall; but after the year 800 there are only four commemor-
ations connected with Hy on record, during the lapse of four hundred years.
