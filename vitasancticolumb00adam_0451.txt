saera Eucharistiae consecrare mysteria (221), sacram oblationem. consecrare (222), sacra
Eucharistiae mysteria- conficere (77), Christe? comeus conficere (8 5). When several priests
were present, one was selected for the office (77, 220), who might 1111110 a presbyter

ciated at the altar, he brake the broad alone, in token of his supeiior office (86). The
brethren then approaehed the altar, and paitook of the Eucharist (158).

011 extraordinary occasions the abbot summoned the brethren by 1110 50111111 of the
bell to the 01111015Υ (33, 170, 213), even in 1110 dead of night (51), 011 which occasions
he addressed them as they stood in 111011· places (170), and having asked ‘their prayers
(m), he kneeled down himself at the altar (170), and sometimes prayed with tears
(171). Sometimes the abbot (123, 163, 224), or a brother (223, 225), rose from his
bed even in a winter night (219, 223), and proeeeded alone 10 1110 oratory for private
devotion⁰ (ὦ), 111111 if the door was closed, prayed 011151110 (22 5). Occasionally the
founder retired in the daytime 10 a thieket to pray (138), and even in Hy, it was his
practice to retire in winter nights 10 lonely places for prayer (205, 219). In al] these
cases the seeular abode was avoided; but in cases of siekness the abbot was went to pray
beside the patient's bed, in a standing (144, 203> or kneeling (146) posture.

The chief Festival was the Pasclmlz's solemnitas (158, 228), 011 which occasion the
Eueharist was celebrated (158), and the season was specially regarded as laetita'aefisti-
rz'tas (229). Τ110 period which elapsed between Easter-day and W'hitsunday
was called paschales dies (1 17), and it was the term of 1110 greatest indul-
. 80110οΡ during the year. For a considerable time after the rectification of the
Pascha] rule ’111 the Church of Rome, the Columbian society tenaciously adhered to the
observance of 111011 founder, where—by there was sometimes as much as a month's inter-
valq between their Easter and that of other ehurches; and it was not until A.D. 716
that they aequieseed in the general practice (28). The Natalitae'mn Domini (1 17) was
another sacred festival, for which some made preparationr during the forty days imme-
diately preceding.

Segienus, abbot of Hy, speaking of his abode in
Rome, says: ⁴* Iu uno hospitio cum Graeco et He-

⁰ Private demam—St. Benedict enjoins the im-
mediate departure of the congregation from the ora-

tory when the office is finished, that any brother

Ρ Indulyence.—It was to save his brethren from
the interruption of this enjoyment that St. Columba
wished his life 1ο be spared till Pentecost (229).
Bede terms this season the remissio quinquagesimae
paschalis (H. E. iii. 5).
