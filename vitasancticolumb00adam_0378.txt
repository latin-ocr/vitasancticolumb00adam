the title of IIeadfort in the Irish, and Kenlis in the British Peerage, to the family of

γ’ Taylor, whose seat is beside the town of KeHs. Kenlis is the 111-3115111011 form of the

name. The site of the monastery was aneiently known as Dan-elzuile-gibrimzep, and
the surrounding territory was called Mayh-Smbvffl. It is situate in the north-west
of the county of Meath, and gives name to 3 parish. The old Irish Life, followed by

is, and blessed it all, and said that it would become the most illustrious possession he
should have in the land, although it would not be there his resurrection should be.’'
O’Donnelr observes that Diarmait granted 11 10 1110 531111 111 amends for injmies which
he had done to him, and that his son Aedh Slane was a consenting party. If 3 church
