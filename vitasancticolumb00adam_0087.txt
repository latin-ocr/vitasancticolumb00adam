Memoir of St. Aclamnan. lxvii
Latinized Acom'a. “ In ea est aedicula S. N inniano saera, ad eujus coenobium in Gal-
vidia tota insula spectat. conjunctum huic aedioulae est ossarium siue sepulehretum
quatuordecim filiorum ss¹¹3³ viri Senchani¹ Hiberni sanctitate illustrium. Saxeo mu-
rulo septum, in quo sunt septem grandia et polita saxa, quibus sanctissima corpora
teguntur, in quorum medio erat obeliscus, altior hominis statum. Nemo mortalium
impune ingreditur illum murulum.”

7. B'z'lleu7zan.—A denomination of land in the parish of Kilkerran, in Cantyre, va-
riously written Killewnane and Kflyownaner, and, no doubt, formed from cuth
Οόωῇηωη. .

8. Dalmeny.—A parisii in Linlithgow, near Queen’s Ferry, having a fine old
Romanesque ohureh. Here was a chantry of St. Adamnan. The wn'ter in the Now
Stat. ΑροοωιὲΖ says: “ From the crown-charter conveying the patronage capallam'ae e!
altaris Sancti Adamanff infra ecelesiam parochialem de Dummcmy, it would appear to
have been dedicated to St. Adaman, as the adjoining parish of Cramond was to
St. Columba and the Vir-gin Mau-53²

At Campsie, in Perthshire, was a croft of land called St. Adamnan’s Aereb.

In the above list it is observable that the dedications of St. Columba and Adamnan
keep very close together. In Ireland, the churehes of Raphoe, Skreen, and Drumhome
are said to be founded by the former, yet under the patronage of the latter. In 80οέ>
land, Forglen is St. Adamnan’s, but in it were St. Columba’s lands of the Banner;
St. Columba's chureh of Tannadice has St. Eunan’s Seat; St. Columba’s ohurch of
Belhelvy neighbours to F urvy3 Ineh Colm‘s nearest land is Inch Keith ; and St. Co-
lumba's Cramond has Dalmeny next adjoining 011 ‘the west.

The memorial appeliation formed from the saint‘s name was Giolla-Adhamlznaiw,
or ¹ Servant of Adamnan.’ It early became a Christian name, and we find an example
of it in the charters of KeUs in the beginning of the twelfth century (p. 404, infra).
It appears about the same time in the Mac Donnell family, for Somerlid, son of Gala>
Adhamnahz, fell in 1 164 (p. 408). Subsequently it became a favourite name in the
family, and passed into that braneh of it called the Mac Neills of Barra. Among them

¹ &achani—The chapel is now locally called
Kilmashenaqhan (Orig. Par. ii. p. 9), that is, Ciu-
mo-Seanomn. Father Mac Cana adds: ‘¹ In illa
insula fuit repertum brachium Sancti Ultani, quod
thecae argentea: inclusum, ante hoc bellum religiose
servabatur a viro generoso ex inclyta Mac Donello-
rum ffirnilia.'’ Could this be the reliquary now
commonly called St. Patrick's Arm ,9 Nothing is

known of its history, and as to the salnes name it

has probably originated in a vulgas guess. See
