Qui scilicet Aldus Niger valde

sanguinarius homo et multorum fuerat trucidator& qui et Diormitium filium

Uladh, and in 588 he lost his life. (Tiqh. So
Annal. Ult. 564, 587; Four Mast. 558,592. See
O'Donovan’s note on last reserenee; and Reeves'
Eceles. Antiqq. pp. 340, 353.)

ἓ Crutliim'cum =‹lenta—The Dal Araidhe, in-
habiting the southern half of the eounty of
Antrim, and the greater part of the county of
Down, were known among the Irish by the
name os eruithne‚ or Piets, also; and their
territory by that of Orno no Cpuu'me, · region
of the Picts.¹ See i. 7 (p. 33) supra, and the
note on the name at i. 49 infra.

s Britanniam—See the note on the word at
Praef. 2, p. 9, supra.

s Habitu—The Irish annals abound with ex-
amples of the exchange of the regal sor the
monastic condition. Niall Freasach, King of
Ireland, after a reign of seven years, retired
to Hy, and, having taken the religious habit,
died in 778. So Selbach of the Dalriada, and
Echtan of the Picts. (Tiylx. 723, 724.) See
Four Mast. 703. “Contemporaneus fuit Sancto
Columbae sanctus Constantinus rex Cornubiae,
qui, relicto regno terreno, regi coelesti militari
coepit, et cum Sancto Columba ad Scotiam per-
venit, et fidem Seotis praedicavit et Pictiss‘-
Fordun. (Scotichr. iii. 26.)

²¹ Trucidator..-His name first appears in the
Annals as the murderer of King Dermot. In
an ancient Life of this sovereign, preserved in
the MS. H. z. 16, Trinity College, Dublin, his
future assassin is introduced at an early stage
of his history, and a reason assigned for the
vindietive feelings which he entertained. 11·

was he, now, [Bec mac De] that said to
Dermaid mac Cerbhaill at Temar, at a time
that the panegyrists were praising the king,
and his peaceful reign, and his accomplish-
ments. Aedh Dubh, son of Suibhne, king of
Dalaraidhe, was before Bec, and it was Der-
maid who killed that Suibhne. And Dei-maid
then took his son in fosterage, namely, Aedh
Dubh son of Suibhne. And Bec said:

O Bec, what hound? said Aedh. A dog that
