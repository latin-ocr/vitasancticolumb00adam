xxx. annis regnavit. ln octavo anno regni
ejus baptizatus est a sancto Columba!y (Irish
Nennius, p. 163.) Ussher, following Hermannus
Contractus, who borrowed from Bede, places
the accession os Brudeus at 557 (Wks. vol. vi.
lud. Chronol.‚ and p. 234); lnnes, ayear earlier
(Civ. Eccl. Hist. p. 193) ; but both dates are
too late, for Brudeus died in 584 (Tigh. An.
Ult. 583; Ussher, Iud. Chr. 584), and subtract-
ing 30, the length of his reign, we are brought
back to 554 forits commencemeut; and thus
563, the true year of St. Columba's removal to
Britain. is found to be the nae'nth of Brudeus'
reign. According to this computation, the
regnal year in the Chron. Pict. is incorrect,
unless we suppose the present visit to have
taken place in 562, the year before the occu-
pation of Hy. It is very possible that this
visit to Brudeus may have been preliminary to
the final settlement in that island. The Scots
having been already converted‚ the missionary
spirit. aud a desire to conciliate the favour os
powerfui neighbours, would naturally lead St.
Columba in their direction, and thus we could
easily reconcile the rival statements of Bede
and Tighernach as to the donation of Hy;
coucerning which Professor Hussey reasonably
observes: ²* Si unquam de jure et possessione
hujus insulae certatum erat inter illos reges,
satis causae haberemus cur adeo diverse a di-
versis auctoribus traditum sit.'' (Bedae, Hist.
Eccl. p. 122.) We may fix on 563 as the most
probable date of the occurrence recorded in
the text.

'³ Suoe munitionis—Mentioned already in i.
37 (p. 73). From chap. 33, supra, where we find
domus ταμία, aula reqia, and reqis munitio, we
learu that it was at some distance, though not
far, from the banks of the river Ness. Now,
as this river has a very limited course, the

circuit of inquiry for the situation of the dun is
greatly narrowed; and there being but one
spot within it which is answerable to the name.
the identification may be regarded as nearly
certain. Craiy Phadrick, situate about two miles
S. W. of Inverness, across the river, is a natu>
ral eminenee of considerable height, and well
defined. On the summit is a level space of au
oval form, about 240 yards iu circumference.
enclosed by a parapet, which, though very
much reduced in height and regularity‚ and
overgrown with vegetable matter, still afl'ords
satisfactory evidence ofits original outline, and
of the solidification of its parts by the action
of fire. Itis one os those rude structures called
Vitrified Fores, and which are regarded by
some as peculiar to the old Pictish inhabitants.
The summit is 435 feet above the level of the
sea, and commands, ubere the ill-judged and
injurious plantation with which it is crowned
permits, a most beautiful and extensive pros-
pect, having a large tract of Rosshire on the
north, Inverness on the east, Beauly on the
west, and Loch Ness on the south. The as-
cent of the hill is rendered difficult by the
dense plantation with which its sides are
cloffied, a species os ornament. better suited
to the neighbouring cminence of Tom-na-hou-
rich than to the hill-fort of the Pictish kings.
There is an interesting description os Craig
Phadrick, accompanied by a sketch and sec-
tion, in “An Account of some remarkable
Ant-ient Ruins in the Highlands, by John Wil-
liams’' (Edinb. 1777), p. 31. The memoir of
Inverness parish in the old Statistical Survey
gives but a meagre account of this curious
fort (vol. ix. pp 610, ⁶34)-
