which was wn'tten from his book, and
they both selected Diarmuid as judge be—
tween them. Thjs is the decision that
Diarmuid made: that to every book be-
longs its son-book [copy] as to every cow
belongs her calf. So that this is 0110 of
the two causes why the battle of Cuile
Dreixnhnc was fought.

This was the cause whieh brought Co>

and against the Ultom'ans, n‘z„ 111 001150-
quence of the controversy that took place
between Colum and Comgall, because they
took part against Colum in that¹ controf,

This was the cause that occasioned the
fighting of the battle of Cuil Feadha
against Colman Mac Diarmada,'⁶ via, in
revenge for his having been outraged in
the case of Baodan, son of Nin1iea(l¹.1(king
of Erin), who was killed by Cuimin, son
of Colman, at Leim-an-eich, in violation
of the sanetuary of Colum.

The book which St. Columba is supposed to have transcribet] from St. F innian's
origine] is not a manuscript of the Gospels, as stated 111 the above extract, but the copy
of the Psalms, which forms, with its 5111·οΥ casey the ancient reliquary called the Cath-
ach, of which O'Donnell gives 115 this oun'ous account :

racter and condition of this manuscript are indicative
