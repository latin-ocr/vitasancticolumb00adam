cord the skill and intelligence which it has been his happiness on all occasions
to expericnce in the operations of that office.

Mr. John BartholomeW, Jun„ deserves great credit for the admirable style
in which he has engraved the two maps which accompany this work. His
merit is enhanced by the consideration that he was previously unacquainted
with the Irish letter, and that in executing the map of Ireland he was at once
the learner and the accomplished artist.

To John C. Nicholl‚ of Merthyr Mawr, Esq„ the editor is indebted for
the use of a manuscript volume⁸ containing Archbishop Ussher’s copyf of
Stephen White’s collationg of the Reichenau codex: and the favour was the
greater as it was conferred upon a stranger.

There was a time when the confident manner in which the name Smtia,
and its derivatives, are limited in the following pages to Ireland and its rela-
tions, would have been pronounced by the inhabitants of North Britain to be
bigotry or presumption3 but fortunately that day of prejudice is past: Chal-

leaf is written: ‘⁵ Sum ex libris Jacobi Tyr-rell,
A. D. 1662.” James Tyrrell was Abp. Ussher's
grandson, and this volume seems to be one of
those which changed hands when Shotover
House passed into another family.

s Ussher’s ςυρψ-Α portion is in the delicate
and beautiful hand of the amanuensis who
prepared a copy os the Primordia (now in the
editor's possession) for the second editiom the
rest is in the Archbishop's own writing.

age of Adamnan, and the style of the memoir,
are subjoined, which agree exactly with what
has been stated in a preceding part of this
Preface. In the margin, opposite S. White‘s ac-
count of the manner in which he became ac-
quainted with the MS„ is the date, “Au. 1621,
31 Maii‚'‘ in Ussher's writing. A marginal
note of Ussher's on the title of the Preface re-
cords the existence of a MS. of Adamnan not
noticed elsewhere: ‘⁴ Ms. San Mielanus in Lo-
tharingia: Incipit Proesatio prima Apoloyiaque
Eadomnani sancti Scriptoris.” S. Miel stands
on the east bank of the Mense, in Lorraine.
