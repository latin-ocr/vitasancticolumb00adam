6 (Colgan‚ Act. SS. p. 336 b); Keating, His-
tory (Req. Aedh). The present reading, how-
ever, is found in all the MSS. Tighernach
recor-ds the death of a Scanlann Mor. son of
Cennfaeladh, at 643, but the interval between
the date of the Convention and that year is too
long to harmonize with the statements in this
chapter. Resides, we find '‘Colmanus filius
Fearaffle, dux regionis Osraidhe‚'' expressly
mentioned in the Life of Cainnech, as that
saint’s patron (ehaps. 43, 44, 47; pp. 26, 27,
29. Ed. Ormonde), as also in the Life of St.
Mochoemog (chap. 30, Colg. Act. SS. p. 594 b);
and his death is recorded by Tighernach at
605, and Four Mast. 601. Cennfaeladh, father
of Scanlann Mor, was first cousin of this Col-
man.

²2 Retentum—Some say that he was delivered
as a hostage by his father; others, that he had
been put in bonds sor refusing to pay the cus-
tomary tribute to the monareh. Again, it is
alleged that one of Aedh's motives for con-
vening this assembly was to procure his formal
deposition, and that one os St. Columba's rea„
sons for attending was to procure his liberation.
See O'Donnell, iii. z (Tr. Th. p. 430 a); Keat-
ing, Hist. (req. Aedh); Colgan (Tr. Th. p. 375,
n. 48.) Irish legends state that the place of
his confinement was Ard-mac-nDobran‚ near
St. Columba’s Dubh Regles at Derry. (H. 2,
16. T. C. D. fol. 680.)

his death preserved in the Book of Lecan states
that he made an expedition into Loinster to
avenge the death of his son Cumuscach, and on
the way he said to his servant, “Bi-ing me Co-
lumcille's eochall [cucullus]‚ that 1 may have it

on this occasion, and received the saint's crosier,
called the Bac-hall Mor, which he carried with
him as a safe conduet; that his father died on
