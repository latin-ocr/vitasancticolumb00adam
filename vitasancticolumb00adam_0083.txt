and some additions which were lately made to it,- in order 10 complete the 001111111111)1
of the path, were speedily removed, as foreign to the original design. The church
derives its name, it is said, from Adamnan’s shrine, which was preserved there. This
shrine might be supposed to enclose St. Adamnan's bones, and 10 be 1110 0350 001113111-
ing the reliqm'oe Adamnam', which were brought over 10 Ireland in 727 for 1110 renewal
of his Law, and which were taken back 10 Hy in 730. But, according to a record in
one of 1110 Β11155015 MSS& which was copied by Michael O’Clery, 111 1629, from ‘¹ 311
01ᾶ black and difficult manuscript of parchment‚’⁷ the 0011101115 of 1110 shrine were the
various relies which Adamnan himself had collected. The record opens by saying,
“ Elustrious was this Adamnan. It was by him was gathered the great collection of
the relies [mopcpo] of the saints into one 51111110, and that was 1110 51111110 which
Cillinc Droicthech¹‚ son ofDicolla‚ brought to Erin to make peace and friendship
between the Cinel Conaill and Cincl Eoghain.” It then proceeds 10 enumerate 1110
twenty-six articles which were. enclosed in 11, consisting of manuscripts of the Gospels,
hymns, and poems; articles of apparel belonging 10 the saints of Ireland3 and a few
relies of St. Paul and the Virgin Mary; the aggregate of which must have filled a
large box, and been a rather heavy load to carry about. Colgan couples this shrine
with the church of 81110011, and observes⁸z “ Est ecclesia multomm reliquiis nobilis 01
veneranda, Dioecesis Kal-aladen. in regione de Τ11 F hiachrach‚ do qua, wide plura in
notis ad Vitam S. Adamnani, ubi dabimust catalogum reliquiarum in illo scrinio recon-
ditarum.⁷' ln 832 the shrine of Adamnan was in the keeping of Tuathal mac Feradh-
aich, Abbot of Reehra and Dum-ow, from whom 11 was carn'ed off from Donaghmojmeu
by the Danes. It is very likely that there were two shrines called Adamnan’s, the
older, containing his own remains', which is the one referred to in the Annals, the
other“‚ containing the miscellaneous objccts mentioned in the catalogue, which was in
after-times coupled with his 1131110, and preserved in his church of Skreen.

years’ interval between his death and the enshrine-
ment of his remains. But the grave of St. Cuth-

bert was opened eleven years after his death, and

his bones were expected to have been sorurd (11·,17
(Bene, H. E. iv. 30). The relies of Bp. Aidan were
enshrined within thirty years of his death (iii. 26).
