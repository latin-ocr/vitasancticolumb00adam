In 179 5, the clergyman of the parish writes :—“ A green eminence, close to the sound
of Ι, 15 to this day called the Druid's burial place (Claodh nan Druineach). A cot-
tager, some year ago, planting potatoes in this spot, and digging earth to cover them,
rought up some bones, which the people of the island immediately concluded to be

the bones of the Druids'' (Old Stat. Acct. xiv. p. 199)!

where unbaptized children used to be buried.

9. AVameless eemetery. At Culbhuirg, on the north-west side of thc island, an old
burydng-ground was exposed some years ago, in which layers of bones were found min-
gled with charcoal. There was no tradition of its existence, so that it had no name.

III.——Cssossns.
Their number was great, indeed, if the anonymous writer of 1693 be deserving of

cited by Pennant, states that “the synod ordered 60 crosses to be thrown into the
sea” (iii. p. 2 5 1). It is also alleged that multitudes of them were carried away to dif-
ferent parts of western Seotland, and among them the two beautiful crosses of Inveraryv
and Campbeltonq. This is all very irrational: it only wants a 5 instead of the cypher,

been misrepresented in Scotch books, which make

Lochaber and the srontiers of the country” (col-

form. The family of Mae Gillacomgan seems to
have been the early possessore of Inverary.
