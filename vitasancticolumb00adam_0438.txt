to print it among St. Columba's supposed compositions, and contents himself with
stating that he had sent a Latin translation of it to a contemporary writer⁵. The Rule
of St. Columbanus‘, and the Poenitentials of him and Cummianu are the 01115* remains
of Irish monastic discipline which have descended to us, and these have probably been
modified by the peculiar institutions of the countrics where they were observed3 and
when they are compared with the Benedictine Rule, in au its beauty of piety, elo-
quence, and method, it is to be wondered how a lesser light could shine beside iv, and
even the one mcagre Irish Ruie have been transmitted to us. When saying that Colum—
banus’s is the only Irish Ruje which has descended to 115, it may be well to mention
that Lucas Holstenius has printed two Rules, one intitules] C'ujussdam Patris Reffula ad
Monachos'v, consisting of thirty-two chapters; and the other, eujusdam Patris Requla
ad Πνρίηεεῑ, of twenty-four ohapters3 which Calmet has attributed to St. Comgall,
but Holstcnius’s editor to St. Columba. This, however, is more conjecture, which is
not supported even by the style or matter of the compositions. In the same collection
there is an Ordo Monastz'cae, purporting to be an ancient rule of discipline, “ ab anti-
quis monachis Scotis sub exordio susceptae Christianae religionis observatus,'' and which
Holstenius's editor considers the most ancient monument of all the monks of the West,
and worthy of ranking next to the institutions of Cassian, and the rule of Paehomius.
But a document which opens, as it does, with an account of the Culdces of Cuiros, and
den‘ves the term Keledeus from cella, however venerable it may appear to a German,
must sax-our to a Scot of mediaeval antiqusty, especially when it is found, almost totidem
serbis, in Ricemarch's Life of Davidz, as the discipline of the Menevian saint.

It is not necessary to reprint in this N ote the only existing Regula Choluoe'm-ehille,
because it is a formula intended more for a hermit than a member of a socia] commu-
nsty, and the book in which it is printed can readily be consulted. The following
