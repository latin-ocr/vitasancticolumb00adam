Scotiae pervenisset, Sanctus Columba primus episeopus in Dunkel puerum suscepit,
unaque 011111 puellula quadam, nomine Brigida ex Hyberm'a oriunda, retinuit et 1111-
quandiu educavit”³. And in the following chapter: ‘¹ Postmodum vero cum matre
puer ad insulam quae Hy dicitur, profectus est, ubi aliquandiu cum religiosis viris loci
1111115 conversatus est.⁷⁷ Now the word Scotz‘a in these authorities savours very much
of circ. 1 100, or later. A writer of that period would find Dunkeld a bishop's see, and
the name Columba 1111111101οΙ)- associated m'th it. Hence, by a process similar 10 111111
which made St. Eunan bishop of Raphoe 111 1101111111, 110 would argue that the founder
of St. Columba’s dioeesan ehureh of Dunkeld was a Columbab and a bishop. But the
fact was otherwise. The Danish descents on Hy in the early part of the ninth cen>
tui-y, and the rise of Kclls in Ireland, had caused a diversion 111 the administration of
the Columbian brotherhood; and when, soon after, the Pictish nation yielded to Seotic
rule, and Kenneth Mae. Alpin transferred 1110 seat of govemment to the eastern side os
the kingdom, a collateral movement took place 111 the ecclesiastical economy of his do-
minions: and accordingly, circ. 849, he founded a chureh at the seat of govermnent,
which was to be an inland Hy, and the representative of the Columbian institution for
the United Kingdom. In fui-therance of this project, St. columkille was named the
patron saint, and a portion of his relies, real or alleged, were deposited in the site, 115 11
material guarantee of the dedicatione. Hence the 9th of J une became the proper festi-
val of Dunkeld, and St. Columba's memory associated with its future historyd. As 1110
new foundation was 055011111111)ν columbian, the intercourse which previously existed
between the mother church and Ireland was extended to the east of Scotland: and
for this reason the few names of the early abbots of Dunkeld which are preserved are
strictly Irish, and found in Irish Annals only. Hy continued to (10011110, and Dunkeld
to rise in importanee; tradition stamped the former with sanctity, but 10)*1111)Ν invested
the latter with power: and, as 11 consequence, when the jurisdiction of bishops began
to be defined by diocesan 11111115, Argyle, including Hy‘, was compriscd within the dio-
cese of Dunkeld, subject, no doubt, 10 occasional interferenee from the Irish coarbs of

St. cuthbert's life is that it supplies the informa-
tiun. omitted by Bede, of St. Cuthbert's Irish ex-
traction. 'rhat the saint was a native of lreland
seems to have been the received opinion in Scotland,
for Fordun, writing circ. 1400. says: “ Ilio Sanctus
eumbertus, filius regiS, in Hibernia natus, et ad
tempus cum Sancto Columba apud Dunkelden edu-
catus.''—Seotichr. iii. 51.
