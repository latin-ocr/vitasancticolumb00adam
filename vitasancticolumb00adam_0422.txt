preceding conjunction, and, dismembering the word, read cu hebor), cum lecto, thus re-
ferring us to the “nuda petra'' of p. 2 33, supra. This liberty they took with the
original, not knowing, it would seem, what cubeboo meant. They found the word
again in the foilowing passage of the Annals of Ulster, which relates an outrage com-

mitted by Tighernan O'Ruairc in 1128, but they have omitted the whole passage:

The successor of Patriek was openly
outraged in his presenee; for his retinue
were plundered, and some of them were

people, whobore a culebadh, was slain there.

Thus it appears that the word was a general term. We are brought a step further
towards the meaning of it by a passage in the Prefaee to the Amhm Coluim-oille:

And the way that Columoifle came was,
with a cere-eloth over his eyes and his
culpmi over that, and the hood of his
cowl over that3 so that he should neither
behold the men nor women of Erinz.

O'Donnell gives the legend, with the addition, that means were taken to prevent
Columba from settz'nq foot on Ireland, but he omits the (lesired word:

‘ There was a sod of the earth of Alba under his feet :

There was his wooHen-eap drawn over that ε
There was his hood, and 1115 cowl, over these outside.'

The Annals of Tighernzmh, at 1090, have the following eurious entry:
