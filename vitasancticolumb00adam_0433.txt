‘The F oreigners of Loch Daehaech left 1reland,
viz.⁷ Raghnall, king of the Danes, with the two
earls Ottir aud Gragava, aud afterwards invaded
the men of Alba. The men of Alba, with the as-
sistance os the North Saxeus, prepared to meet
them. The Danes divided themselves into four
battalions: one led by Godsrey Ua ulman, another

for Columkisse was aiding them; for they
had prayed to him most ferventiy, because

the men of Alba saw were routed by them, and
