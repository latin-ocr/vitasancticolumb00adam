considerable one, as the messenger crossed it
on foot to get the boat; unless we interpret
ultra as meaning ‘ having crossed.'

⁸ Celeia-Here, and iii. 15, we have the Latin
form of the name Colga, while in the title we
have the Irish, in the genitive case. Colyen
is the genitive in i. 43,1'nfr11. So Celluiy in
the title, the genitive of Cellach, which is la-
tinized Cellaclzi in iii. 15, infra. Colgan‚ the
hagiologist's name, is properly Mac Colgan,
‘son of Colga,' which the Annals of Ulster read
Mac Colqen at 621. The subject ofthe present
anecdote is mentioned again at iii. 15, under
similar circumstances. Colgan notit-es him in
his Aeta at Feb. 20, but adduces nothing addi-
tional of importanee. He supposes him to have
been a bishop from the expression 111oe dioece-
sees, possibly Colga of Kill-cholgan'in Dealbh-
na-Eathra or Garrycastle. (Act. SS. p. 381.)
Dr. Lanigan‚ however, observes that *⁶ the
phrase your diocese may mean no more than the
diocese in Ireland to which Colgeus belonged,
without his being bishop of it.” (Ecel. Hist. ii.
p. 328.) But both suppositions are open to this
grave objection, that diocesan episcopacy was
unknown at this period in Ireland. See the
following note. Tighernach, at 622, records
the death of Colqa mac Ceallaiq. So Ann. Ult.
621 ; Four Mast. 617 ; and the two names in the
same relation occur again in the Four Masters
at 776, 849. The word eidem refers to the
name in the titulus, and proves the genuine-
ness of it. The Bollandists, who have thrown

all these chapters into a continuous narrative,
and have disearded the tituli, so as not to inter-
rupt the tenor, oecasionally create a defect in
their text, by omitting, as in the present in-
stance, the antecedent.

²· Dioeceseos.-The word used in the oldest
Irjsh records to denote ‘a diocese' is parochia.
(S. Patricii Synod. 30, 34, Villanueva, pp. 5, 6.
Puruchio, Lib. Armac. fol. 1 1 α b, 16 α α, 20 b b,
21 b b, 22 a a.) Sulpicius Severus uses ‹lioecesis
in the sense of ‘parisiis and parochia of ‘an
episcopal seat.‘ (Vit. S. Martini, Lib. Armac.
fol. 209bh, 220 aa, zozblt3 pp. 578, 526, 550,
Ed. Hornii.) In the present instance the term
diaecesis seems, like the Greek ἒιοὶκησις, to be
taken in the sense of *administratione or, se-
condarily, of ‘ districts conveying the idea
expressed b‘y “quidam de provincialibus tuis
clericiS,’' iii. 7 infra. In this sense it is eni-
ployed in the sulitary instance in which it
occurs in the ancient memoirs of St. Patrick in
the Book of Armagh (fol. 20 b h). In the case
of widely extended monastic systems, like that
os St. Columba, while the supreme government
was vested in the superior ofthe mother church,
there were local administratore, under whose
direction the churches of a particular district
οι· province were unitedly placed, and the pre-
sent expression seems to have reference to such
jurisdiction. Occasionally we read, in the An-
nals, ofthe moon τηυιηςηιε Docpcneo, ‘ Stew-
ard of the congregation of S. Patrick‚' in a
certain province* See Eccles. Antiqq. of Down
