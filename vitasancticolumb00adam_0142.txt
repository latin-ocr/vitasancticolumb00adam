tle of Cooldrevny was fought. The epithet tioned in the text, he granted to St. Colman-

bpon-bnchott‚ which O‘Conor interprets baculi
dolorosi, seems to have reference to the ‘pil-
grim's staff! By supplying the word filii be-
fore Commani in the title we have the exact
lineage given by Mac Firbis; while the word
mors in the passage cited from the Annals, as
opposed to occisio or juquluho, indicates the na-
tural death recorded in the text; and the date
648, reckoning even from the latest period
of our saint's life, allows ample time for the
subject of the prediction to become a senex.
Such harmony in three independent records is
a remarkable attestation of their accuracy.

³ Aidus Slane.—Eldest son of Diarmait Mac
Cerbhaill, by Mughaina (Vit. S. Aidi, Colgan,
Act. SS. p. 4²0 a); and surnamed from the
river Slaine, near which he was born. (Keat-
ing, An. 587.) As heir to the lordship of the
Southern Hy Neill, he was a eonsenting party
to the grant of Ceanannus‚ or Kells, to St. Co-
lumba. (O'Donnell, i. 64, Tr. Th. p. 400.) On
his father's death he succeeded to that dignity,
and, about the year 580, at the instance of St.
Columba, possibly on the very occasion men-

Elo the land of Fiodh-Elo in Ferceall, where
the church of Lann>E10 or Lynally was subse-
quently built. (Vit. S. Colmaneli, MS. Ε. 3,
11, Trin. Coll. Dubl. fol. 106 α h; Ussher, Wks.
vi. p. 530.) On the death of Aedh son of Ain-
mire, in 598, he, and Colman Rimidh, one of
the Cenel Eoghain, were elected joint sove-
reigns. His abode was on an island in Loch
Leibhinn, now Lough Lene, near Fore in West-
meath. (Vit. S. Fechini, Colgan, Act. SS. pp.
135 b, 141 a; Vit. S. Aidi, ibid. p. 421 α.)
