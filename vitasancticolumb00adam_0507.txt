Sumamed Mac Ronain. In the seventh charter of Kells is the name of a coarb of Colum-
cille, which is partly illegible, but the portion which is distinct, namely‚ Maelbn‘y . . . nan,
seems resemble to this abbot (Miscell. Ir. Arch. Soc. p. 148). Whether owing to the decline
of Kells, or the growing influence of Dei-ry, or what is more probable, the commencement of
diocesan episcopacy in Ireland, the title of Com-b qf Columcille is intermitted in the Annals at
this period, and is afterwards resumed, more ns an honorary than a real dignity. It is ‹¹011-
tinued, indeed, in the Charters of Κ9115, to the abbots of that church, but when next it appears
in the Annzsss, it is transferred to Dei-ry, which church seems to have derived an impulse at this
period from its connexion with Armagh (see An. 1 122, 1 137), but more especially from the
circumstance that the southern Hy Neill of Meam, under whose pati-onage, during the long-
continued period that they were supreme, the chief monastery of their territory proportionately
flourished, had now declined in power, and the Cine] Eoghaiu, the chief branch of the nonhern
Hy Neill, now represented by the Mac Lochlainns, and afterwards by the O’Neills, were rising
into power, whose various clauus, scattered over Tyrooe, exercised their influence in Armagh,
while their kinsmen of luis-Eoghain‚ having Derry in their territory, 111 a great measure con-
trolled its appointments also.
