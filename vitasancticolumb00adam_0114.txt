slew Eanfrid, King of Bernicia,0swald's eldest
brother. Proceeding to lay waste Nerthum-
bria, he encountered Oswald, on whom the
united government had devolved, and was slain
in battle—See note Ζ, p. 16 infra.

British name, is thus recorded by Nennius:

and the Annals of Ulster, andos Cambria 630:

1⁸ Alta proceritas.—Though the ⁸· 0013 major
imag& was of old an acknowledged property
of the shades (Virgil. AEn. ii. 773; Ovid, Fast.
ii. 503; Juvenal, xiii. 221 ; Tacitus, Ann. xi. 21 ς
Hist. i. 86), it might be that Oswald, fresh from
Scotland. and probably *from Iona, was im-
pressed by the description he had heard of S.
Columba's personat appearance, which, being
matter of only thirty-six years' tradition,
was likely to be fresh and true. He had
heard that the saint had mingled a good deal
in military matters before his departure from
Ireland, and that he had the credit of more than
once turning the scale of victory by his prayers.
The tradition of S. Columba’s great stature
may subsequently have given a character to
the vision which Alexander ΙΙ. saw in the
island of Kerara, when on his way against
Haeo, in 1263: ‘¹ King Alexander‚then lying in
Kiararey Sound, dreamed a dream, and thought
three men came to him. He thought one of
them was in royal robes, but very stern, ruddy
in countenance, something thick, and 0101111-
ling size. Another seemed of a slender make,
but active, and of all men the most engaging,
and majestic. The third again, was of very
yreat stature, but his features were distorted,
and of all the rest he was the most unsightly.
The Hebridians say that the men whom the
King saw in his sleep were St. Olave King of
Norway, St. Magnus Earl of Orkney, and St.
Columba.''—(Norw. Account of Haco's Expe-
dition, by Johnstone pp. 10-13.)
