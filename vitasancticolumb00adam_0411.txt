who places his removal to Scotland at 56 5, the length of his pilgrimage 32 years, and
1115 death, when he was about 77 years of agem.

But against this evidence may bc alleged the authority of Tighemach‚ who records
Quies Colm'mcz'lle in noete Domc‘niea Pentecostes v. Id. szz'z, mmo pereyrinacionis sue
xxxv. etatis vero lxxvii. With this statement, that he died on ¹NVhitsunday, agree tho
ancient Irish Life, cited in note Β, p. 234, aulam, and the N aemhsenchas, which, under
the saint's name, has Cp! cengcmt'np Columellh z (1 gen, (1 bochw, (1 bor, ¹ Three

Now, in 597, Whitsunday fell on the znd of J une, but in 596 on the roth. If, there-
fore, the Whitsun element enter into the calculation, the year of the death must be
assigned to 596, and Adamnan’s mode of computation be inverted; sor, in this case,
the midm'ght between Saturday and Sunday must be attracted to the former in order
to fit the obit into the 9th, while, at the same time, an opposite process must be adopted
in order to identify the occurrence with the ensuing Pentecost. This date, which seems
to follow from Tighernach, is adopted by Herma-nnus Contractus, who places St. Co-
lumba’s death at 596. But it is opposed to Tighernach‘s own calculation, who assigns
the saint's birth to 520, and allows him an age of 77 years. Dr. Lanigan accounts for
this discrepancy by supposing that “ Tighernach waS, probably, prepossesscd'with the
idea that 596 was the real year of his death, as he might have found it marked in some
elder annals, which, however, consider-ing their mode of computation, waS‚ in fact, the
same as 597. Then, finding that Pentecost feu in 596 about the 9th of J unc, he sup-
posed it to be the Sunday on which Columba djed”⁰. Or, it may be urged that, as
Columba's removal to Britain is said by some to have been at Whitsuntide, Prima 7105
ejece in A lbaz'n in Pentecosteffl, 311 even period was assigned to the term of his pilgrimage,
the chronicler being desimus to square the matter, by placing the obit attho same festi-
val. It is further to be observed that, supposing Whitsunday to have been on the znd,
which it most probably was, the saint’s dcccase was inside the week, and was thus
within the octave of Whitsuntide; for the festival of Trinity Sunday was not yet insti-
tutedq, and Easter and Pentecost were the two great ecclesiastica] seasons of the year.
Dr. Lanigan very justly observes, that “ Adamnan, who mentions more than once this
obituary Sunday, never calls it Pentecost, which, had it been so, he would 3551116111)-

have noticed as a very remarkable circumstance, combining the saint's removal to
heaven with the celebration of that great festivity”‘.
