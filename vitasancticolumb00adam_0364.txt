¹ Uornmc.—-The two poems which are here printed
may not be genuine, but they are compositious of
vousiderable antiquity, and indicate the early no-
fions which existed in Ireland about Cormae's ad-
ventures. and his relation to St. Columba. Their
titles are given in Colgan's list of St. Columba's
reputed writings (Tr. Th. p. 472 α, num. 15, 16),
aud the copies of them which he used are preserved
in tho Burgundiau Libras-y at Bmssels, in a volume

of manuscript collection-5 made by Michael O‘Clery.
At the end of the former poem is a note stating that
it was copied. Dec. 22, 1630, at Drobhais [the river
Drowes, which separatos Donegal from Leitrim] from
the New Book, written by Maurice, son of Paidin
O’Maolconaire. It was probably from the original
employed by O'Mulconry, that O'Donnell borrowed
the matter which he subjoffls, in his Lise of St. Col-
umba, to the narrative of Cormac's voyages, ii. 64
