Summary of St. Columba’s Life.

lxix

7th of Decemberh is determined for an event, the date of which might otherwise have
been umecorded¹; and the Irish Calendarsj, in notieing it, present at that day, the
anomaly of a secular commemorationk. Authorities vary as to the year¹‚ ranging from
518 to 52 3 ; but calculation from Adamnan’s datam gives 521 as that most likely to be

the t-rue period.

copy of his Life is preserved in one of the Ware
MSS. in the British Museum (Cod. Clar. 39, Add.
No. 4788), aud it contains the following passage:
“Sed et ipso sanctissimo die obitus sui de sancto
Columba spiritualiter vaticinans ait, Hodie, inquit,
natus est infans cui nomeu Columba, qui coram Deo
et hominibus gloriosus existet, quique post xxx‘ss
annos abhinc huc veniet. et meum sepulcrum revela.-
bit, et cemiterium designabit” (fol. 73). The old
Irish Life of St. Columba contains exactly the
same statement. The Round Tower and majestic
crosses of Monasterboice are objecta well known to
the antiquary.

¹¹ Seventlt ⁰f December.—The Irish Life adds:
Oupomn 11111,οῃ (11 lael peecnmine, ‘on Thurs-
day, of the week-days.' This will give the choica
of 517 and 523 for his birth: for, Dec. 7 is e, there-
fore, it being Thursday, Ais the Sunday letter, which
belongs to the above years.

ί Otherwise unrecorded.—In like manner, a syn-
chronisrn rendered the birth-day of Alexander the
Great notorious.

i Irislz Calendars.—Marian Gorman, at Dec. 7,
has §ein Cholunn euro coeni5it, which Colgan
reuders “ Nativitas S. Columbae immaculati et prae-
elari'' (Trias Th. p. 483 a). The Calendar of Do-
negal has §ein Come-eille, ⁸ the Birth of
Columcille.’

¹* Secular commemoration.-—The Breviary ofAber-
deen thus limits the admission of such z ‘¹ Post illum
sacrosanctum domini nostri natalem diem nullius
hominis legimus nativitatem celebrari: nisi solum
beati iohannis baptiste: in aliis sanctis et electis
dei novimus illum diem coli: quo illos post con-
summacionem laborum et devictum triumphatumque
mundum in perpetuas eternitates presens vita par-
turiiw-Propr. SS. Part. Estiv. fol. 15 bb. Baert
observes on the present case: “ Verum, cum non
soleat Nativitas sanctorum festive celebrari, prae-

terquam Β. Mariae Virginis et S. Joannis Baptistae,
quia horum, et non aliorum Nativitas, sancta et
immaculata ab omni peccato exstitit, crediderim hoc
potius memoriae causa a Germano inscriptum Mar-
tyrologio fuisse, quarn venerationis.¹'—-Act. SS. Jnn.
torn. ii. p. 183 α.

¹ ream—The Annals of Ulster waver between
518 and 522. At the former date they say: “Na-
tivitas Coluimcille eodem die quo Bute mac Bronaigh
dormivit ;¹' at the latter, “Vel hic nativitas 001111111-
cille.'' Tighernach places it in the same year with
the battle of Detua, and the year after the death os
Conlaedh, which was synchronous with the acces-
sion ofJustin the elder, in 518, The Four Masters
fix St. Buite's death at 521. The Annals of Inis-
fallen have 51 1, aud those of Boyle 4993 but their
respective systems of computation are peculim· to
themselves. O'Donnell calculatos 520 (iii. 57, Tr.
Th. p. 441 b). Ussher adopts 522 (Brit. Eccl. Ant.
Index chronol.) ς Colgan, 5 19 (Tr. Th. p. 486 a);
while Dr. Lanigan fixes on 521 (Eccles. Ilist. vol.
ii. pp. 106, 114). The statement in the Ixish Life
gives 523 (note ὴ, supra). Nennius has the follow-
ing chronological note: “ Α nativitate Columbae
usque mortem sanetae Brigidae quatuor anni sunt⁰
(Hist. Brit. ξ 16, ed. Stevenson). Unfortuuately.
the exact date of St. Brigid's death is alike matter
οἱ controversy.

mAdamnan's datm—St. Columba was in his sorty-
second year when he removed to Hy (Pref. 2, p. 9),
that is, iu 563. In that year Whitsunday fell on
the 13th of May, so that he was then 41 years,
5 months, and 6 days, old. Add to this, 34 years
sor his sojoum in Britain (ib. and pp. 227, 228),
and we get the date-597, so that the 9th of June in
that year found him 75 years, 6 months, and 2 days,
old. Thus, with the Four Masters and Dr. Lanigan,
we get 621 as the year of his birth. Bede's state-
ment is that St. Columba died cum esset annorum
