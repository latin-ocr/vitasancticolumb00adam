And this misapprehension appears, even at a reeent date, in the Fasti Ecelesiae Hiber-
nieae, where the learned compiler observes of the first bishop of Raphoe, “ St. Eunan
is commonly reported to have ereoted the abbey chureh of Raphoe into a cathedral, and
to have been its first bishop3 but nothing certain appears to be known of him. nor of
the time at which he lived'⁷¹. What is more remarkable, St. Eunan’s day has been
observed on the 7th of September, while St. Adamnan’s was kept on the 2 3rd. Bat-
tersby’s Catholic Directory for 18 55 represents St. Eunan, the patron saint of Raphoe,
as a lesshopffl‚ but of the famous individual called by Ven. Bede Adamnan prexbytern,
ὂυόεὶς λόγος. Such an error should not have been committed in the century, one of
the ornaments of which had said: “ Ι strongly suspect that St. Eunan, who is usually
called the first bishop of Raphoe, was no other than Adamnan’⁷⁰.

Seottish writers are less in error. The Breviary of Aberdeen correctly places
S. Adampnanus, Abbas‚ at Sept. 23¹³; Adam King and Dempster commemorate St.
Thewnanq, who is represented as preceptor of King Eugenius VI„ at Sept. 233 and
Keith, in like manner, only that he represents the saint by the name of Thennan¹.
The Seoteh Prayer Book of 1638, in its Calendar, borrows the Irish error of making
him a bishop, and places his day at Sept. 25. But T. Innes was awai-e of these inae-
curaeies, and spoke of Adamnan as “ called by the vulgar S. Deunan or Th<=unan”³.

Among English writers, Alban Butler* repeats Sir J ames Ware’s mistakes; while
Sir Harris Nieholas, gathering up the blundel-s of Ireland and scotland, makes a tri-
partite division of Adamnan's sanetity, and sets out in his Calendaru—

Eunan, Bishop of Raphoe, ...... at Sept. 7;
Adamnam, Abbot, . . . . . . . . . at Sept. 233 and
