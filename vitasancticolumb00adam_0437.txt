pline’ or ‘observance’k; While the mention of written rules¹ is rare and legendary.
There certainly existed, in the middle ages, not only a great dirersity in monastic
praeficem, but also an understanding that the fathers of the Irish Church had established
and defined a variety of orders. An ancient Life of Ciaran of Clonmacnois limits
them to eight, and enumerates them under the names of “ S. Patricii, Brandani, Kie-
rani Cluanensis, Columbae Hiensis, eujus ordo dicebatur Pulchrae Soez'etatis, Comgalli,
Adamnani, Brigidae‚ Molassi seu Lasriani''¹¹; but the recital is evidently arbitrary:
for St. Adamnan, instead of being the author of a new Rule, was unable to induce the
society of which he was ninth abbot to accept the reformed Paschal canon. Possi—
bly, the biographer supposed, as did Ussher⁰ in a later age, and others after him, that
the Lex of Adamnan, Patn'ck, Ciaran, Brendan, δῖα, mentioned in the Irish Annals,
denoted formulas of monastic government. Ussher further states that the Rules of
Columbakilli, Gomgall‚ Mochusta, and Albe were extant in the manuscript from which
he publishod his catalogue of the saints, but “ Hibernico sermone antiquissimo exaratae
et nostris temporibus pene ignorabili’'¹³. It was probably from this or a similar col-
lection that the Irish Rules, preserved in the Brussels MS„ were transciibcd. Through
the exertions of the Rev. Dr. Todd, copies of them have been obtained in this country,
and by his kind permission the present writer was enabled, in 1850, to print the Rulc
of St. Columba in the Appendix to Colton's Visitation of Derry (p. 109). It differs
from the others in being written in prose. They are all very ancient compositions,
but totally insufficient to convey any definite idea of the peculiarities of the orders to
which they profess respectively to belong. Colgan, who h'ved before the dispersion of
Irish records, and had the best opportunity of discovering such literary monuments
was not awai-e of the existence of any other Rule of St. Columba but the one just men-
tioned¹, and it is evident that he attached but little importancc to it, as he has omitted
