336 Additional Notes. „ [K
by the extino‘tion of eonventual observanee, and the virtual transfer of the endowments
to lay possession, as in Bangor‘³‚ or by the repetition of irregularities such as St. Ber-
nard complains of in the ease of Armaghe.

These sixth-eentury monasteries were as rapid in their growth as they were numer-
ous in ‘their ereation. St. Finnian‘s of Clonard is said to have numbered 3000 mem-
bers‘, St. Comgall's ofBangor the same amount, and St. Brendan’s paroclcz'ag 3000 more.
The ramifioations of these houses spread exaetly in the same manner as St. Columba'S,
and, for a time, were fully equa] in extent to his; but they wanted the severalty of
position which the Columbian contre enjoyed3 they had no Pictish raee to eonvert;
and, above all, they had no Adamnan to perpetuate the honours of their founders

W'hether St. Columba or any of his contemporaries composed and promulgated a
systematie mle like St. Benedict's is very doubtful. Reyner expressed his opinion in
the negativeh: and though Fleming and O'Conor have condemned him for the asser-
tion, they have failed in proving the affirmative of the question. wilfi-id, indeed,
spoke at the synod of Whitby of reyula (ιαμ-(0001110 of Colmba‘, and in the Lives of
some of the Irish saints tho term regula 0001115, but generally in the sense of ‘ disci-

former omitting to keep up the 511000551011 of the
latter. In such case the tenant in possession might
maintain a semblance of the clerical character by
taking the tonsure and a low degree of orders. This
is very much what Giraldus cambrensis states con-
cerning the Abbates laici of Ireland and Wales(1ti-
1101111. Cambr. ii. 4). The so-called Canons of St.
Patrick recognise the relation of the ⁴“clericus et
uxor ejns'' (can. 6) ; aud Pope Gregory, in 601, pre-
scribed for St. Angustiae. “Si qui vero sunt cleriei
extra sacros ordines constituti, qni se continere non
possunt, sortiri uxores debent, et stipendia sua ex-
terius aceipere” (Bede, H. E. i. 27).

from the Irish Genealogies and Annals, affords a
remarkable illustration of St. Bemard's “haeredita-

Adamnan himself describes Fintan as leading ¹⁸ in-

numeras ad patriam animas ecelestem’' (21). Bede
estimates the congregation of the Welsh Bangor at
2100 (H. E. ii. 2). Serapion of Arsinoe more than
trebled any of these, ἀμφὶ τοὺς μυρίους ὑφ’ ἑαυτὸν
ἔχων (Sozomen. H. E. vi. 28).

‘s' Paroclzia.-See p. 6 5, supra. In monastic
language a parochia was the jurisdiction of a Su—
perior over the detached monasterias of the order.
Cogitosus says of St. Brigid: “cuj us parrochia per
totam Hiberniensem terram diffusa'⁷ (Pr-01„ Tr. Th.
p. 5 1 8). St. Breudan ‘⁴ cum venit de navigio suo quae-
tendo terram repromissionis sanctorum, tuuc parro-
chia ej us per diversas regiones Hybernie dilatata est '¹
(Cod. Marsh. fol. 57 l> a). St. Ciaran was styled
“Leath nEirinn, i. e. ‘dimidium Hibemioe‚' par-
ochia enim ejus per medium Hybemiae dilatabitur''
(ib. ful. 146 αα); and his influeuce was so great
that “valde enim parochiam Hiberniae apprehende-
ret” (ib. fol. 147 bb).
