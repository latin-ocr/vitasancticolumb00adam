fortress of Duu-da-bheann was on the north-
western edge of the true Ultonian territory,
while Duo-Ceithern was within the debateable
ground which now constitutes the north of the
county of Londonderry. Cethern was of the
stock of Ir‚ from which the Irish Picts are said
to have derived their origin (Ogyg. p. 190;
Reeves' Ec, Ant. p. 336); but the possession
passed from his family to the sons of Niali, and
remained so until the battle of Ocha, when it
was temporarily restored to the Dalaradians
or Picts. (See note ⁰, p. 32, supra.) lt was
recovered by the Hy Neill after the battle of
Moin-doire-lothair in 563 (ibim), and thence-
forward was a scene of contentiori between the
rival races. In 572, the joint sovereigns of
Ireland, who were of the racc of Eogban, were
slain by Gronau, king of Cianacffla, the terri-
tory on the border os which Dun Ceithern was
situate (note ὃ, p. 40, supra) ; and the battle re-
ferred to in the text arose out of the slaugbter
of Suibhne Meann, who was also a sovereign
of the race of Eoghan‚ by Congal Claen, king
of Uladh, himself a Dalaradian or Pict, who is
supposed to have undertaken the deed upon the
condition of receiving from Domhnall, the suc-
cessor to the throne, a restoration of the terri-
tory which had been seized by the Cinel Eoghain.
(Bat. of Magh Rath, p. 39.) Again‚ in 681,
this very t'ortress was the scene of a conflict,
as related by Tighernach: ¹* Combuseio reyum

we again find the lords of the Dalaraidhe and
Cianachta ranged against the chief of the house
of Eoghan. This is the last mention of the for-

tress in history, and probably it soon after
ceased to be occupied. ln later timeS, even the
name passed out of memory, and O‘Donnell,
writing of this interview, vaguely says: ⁶· Quo-
dam tempore S. Columba et S. Comgallus cum
moram traherent in regione Kianachta ad
amoenos clivos et dunos mari adjacentes,³' etc.
—i. 95. (Tr. Th. p. 404 b.) Colgan‚ who was
born in the neighbouring barony of Inishowen,
does not seem to have been acquainted with the
situation of the place, and, failing him, it has
been reserved for the great restorer ol' Irish
topography to identify the place and its long
lost name. Writing‚ Aug. 18, 1834, Dr. O'Do-
novan, then employed on the Ordnance Sur-
vey, emphatically observes: ⁴⁴ 1 have travelled
through Dunboe, but found no Irish people. 1
visited the Giant's Sconce, and viewed it with
religious contemplation. 1 am perfectly satis-
fied that it is the Munitio Cethirni of Adamnan,
and the Dun Ceilltirn of Tighernach and other
annalists. 1 have consulted several of the old-
est inhabitants around it. but none could tell
me any legend connected with it. They only
heard that it was called Lunyern in Irish, which
is also the name by which the townland is known
to tax-gatherers.’⁷ (Londonderry Letters, Ord.
Surv. p. 60.) The hill commonly called the
Sconce is the most conspicuous one in the>
neighbourhood of Coleraine, sitiriate about four
miles west of that town, in the parish os Dunboe,
ou the old Newtown road. It is 797 feet above
the level of the sea¹ and the top, which is a ta-
ble measuring 160 by 94 feet, exhibits the re-
mains of an ancient fortress. On the west and
south, opposite Bratwell [blanilebffi Tigh.

east it is less so, and at a lower level has a
