v. 3, 4. This volume contains the lives of twenty-eight saintsffi, all 111511,
except St. Anthony. It is written in double columns. The chapters are not
numbered by the original hand, and are only distinguished by large red initials.
Its textis of the shorter recension‚ but differs from the other MSS. of the
501118 family in occasionally departing from the usual order of the Chapters, and
by reducing Adamnan's involved const-ructions to the more natural order of
the words. It generally substitutes Hyberm'a¹² for Scotia, Hybernienses for
Scotieuses ; and, when it 0011185 to an Irish name, departs from the usual mo-
nastic hand, and writes the word in the native character0. It is almost certain
that this is the manuscript which Ussher speaks of when, citing Adamnan, he
writesv: ‘⁶ De scotia (sive ut MS. meus eodem sensu habet, Hibernia) ad
Britanniam ;” and againq: ‘⁶ Moctheum enim, in MS. quo usus 50111 codice, ibi
nominatum invenio: pro quo Manetius in libris Adamnani editis.”

V. Codex F. A vellum manuscript in 4to. saec. x., consisting of fifty leaves.
It formerly belonged to the church of Freisingen‚ situate at the ι1011011οο of
the Moosach and Isar, in Bavaria3 under the number 141, and is now in the
Royal Library of Munich‚ 6341. It is the most respectable manuscript of the
shorter recensi0n‚ and often exhibits the proper names in a very correct form.
It was collated for this edition in 1853, by Professor Conrad Hofmann of
Munich, and the facsimile in Plate IV. No. 1, was made by Mr. Schenk of
that city. The memorandum at top of the first page, Iste liber est sancte

1135 been frequently referred to, was given to
it hy the late Mr. Downes, who conjectured
that some Lives published by Colgan from 3

Codex Kilkermiensis were taken from it; but a
slight comparison shows that it is not Colgan’s
original. Codex Armaclmnus is more likely to
be its correct designation.

Resides No. 2, Nos. 4, 20, 21 have been liberally
consulted for the present work. Cod. E. 3y 11,
of Tr³nity College Library, is 3 collection of
Irish Lives bearing 3 great resemblance to
this. but greatly inferior in value on account
of its numerous chasms. The Lives of Colman
Ela, Barr, and Albeus, contained in it, are oc-
casionally referred to in this work.
