The Bau-112, called robostin the Irish Life, was an out-office of considerable import-

ancc ( 2 30). Here the grain, when sequestratus (2 30) or winnowed‚ was

uon-eum. stored in heaps (ib). We may presume that it was situate near the kiln

and the mill.

The Kfln was employed both for the trituratio frte-qum (56), and ad spicas siccan-

das (88 n). The latter process was conducted in a large sieve, rota de

canaba. rz'rffl's contexta (Νι). This building stood near the path which led from
‘the monastery to the landingplaee (87).

Adamnan does not mention the MflP, but he speaks of the baker, and of bread. A

stream, which flows eastwards, a little to the north of the monastery, is still called

Srzctlz-a-mhalliun, or ‘ Mill-stream? It rises in a bog called the Lon-lum

molendinum mor, or ‘ Great Lakelet, which may have served as a. lum m mustum, or

*mm-pond‘b. The stream is small now, because the Lochan is nearly

drained3 but there are no traces of a weir, and the wheel of the mill was possibly a

horizonta] onec. In the founder‘s time, the bpo, or ‘ quern,’ may have been the mffl
in use, for such was the grindjng appara-„ms at the school‘l where he was taught.

¹ Ecum—The old word rubuU, from which two
churches in Irelaud took their names (Reeves's
Eccl. Ant. pp. 220), and from which Irish hagiolo-
gists coined the word zabulum to denote ‘a barn‚' is
preserved in the spoken language of Ulster, but in
the other provinces of Ireland it is corrupted to
Γδιῦοῑ. The Brehou laws mention the ioblcmn
frumenti repositorium.

corn were concluded.‘ Leabhar Breac, fol. 109 α.
See p. 330, supra. St. Fechin, who flourished in
the interval between Columcine and Adamnan,
erected a water-mill near his abbey of Fore, which
is mentioned in his Life, cap. 14 (Colg. Act. SS.
p 13i b), and spoken of by Giraldus Cambrensis
(Topogr. Hib. dist. ii. cap. 52). See O'Donovan

St. Constantine, on his conver-sion, in 588, “relicto
reg-no in hyberniam transfretavit veniensque ad
quamdam dffium religionis humiliter laborem sus-
tinuit quod'ffiolenda quaeque de granario ad molen-
dinum ferret per septennium.'¹ Brev. Aberd. Pr.
SS. Pt- Hyem. f. 67 ιι b, lect. 2 (Reprint). The re-
ference is, probably, to Rahen, in King's Count'y.
