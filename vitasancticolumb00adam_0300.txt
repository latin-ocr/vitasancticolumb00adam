nasterii), and was intituled Auctore Cummeneo
Albo. Thus a work which was supposed by
some to have been lost was brought to light
from two independent sources. It forms the
groundwork of Adamnan's third book, into
which he has transferred the whole tract, with
the exception of two chapters which he has
worked into an earlier part, observing the
order of the narrative, and in many instances
employing the very expressions of his prede-
cessor. The Bollandist editor was of opinion
that the scribe who wrote the Compeigne MS.
‘¹ recentiorem Latinaeque linguae studiosorem
fuisse‘' than the writer of the Belfort exemplar,
and for that reason gave a preference to the
latter as 3 text for the l'ita Brevior at St. Co-
lumba’s day. (Act. SS. Jun. tom. ii. p. 185 b.)
On compar-ison, however, it will be found that
Mabillon’s text agrees better with Adamnan's
than that of Colgan. The Irish Franciscans,
who saved the hagiology of their country, sup-
posed that the Life, or rather portions of two
Lives, which are preserved in the Codex Sal—
manticcnsis, and are printed No. 2 in Colgan‘s
collection, were the genuine production of
Cummineus. Accordingly O'Clery‚ in the Ca-
lendar of Donegal, under Cummian Fionn, at
Feb. 24, observes: Ὁο Γῦῐηοῢ δί’ἐα Colmm-
ciLLe ι 34 bo emboil1b‚ompob cupl’en. Abbas

Life of Columkille in 34 chapters, which com-

mences thus: Venerabilis Abbas, &c.¹ This
description led Colgan to express it as his opin-
ion that the second Life in his collection was
by Cummineus; and though he was unable to
find in it the passage cited by Adamnan, he
supposed that its absence was caused by a
chasm in the manuscript. Pinkerton reprints
Mabillou‘s text, (Vit. Antiq. pp. 27-45.)

mineus' words as found in Mabillon's text, to
which are added in brackets the variations in
Colgan: “ Indubitanter crede ο Aidane, quo-
niam [quod] nullus adversariorum tuorum [om.
Colg.] tibi poterit resistere donec prius frau-
dem agas in me et in posteros meos. His eisdem
[ipsis] verbis alloquere filios tuos, ne reguum
perdant. Quod si nou obaudierint flagellum
quod causa tui ab Angelo Dei [om. Colg.] sus-
tinui, in eos retorquebitur.'' (Aet. SS. Bene-
dict. Ord. i, p. 343; Colg. Tr. Th. p. 32¹ ὂς
