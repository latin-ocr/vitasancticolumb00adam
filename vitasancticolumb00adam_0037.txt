Prqface. xxi

αφιομεν τοις αφιλη ταις ημων- καιμ η εις ενεγκης ημας εις πιρασμωυ. αλλα pv σαι
ημ ας απο του πουερου. The eaprieious subdivision of the words is strikingly
exemplified in old Irish writing, otherwise one could suppose that when
Greek writing had lately emerged from the continuity of uncia] style, the
scribe, copying from such a text, might have been occasionally embarrassed
by the want ofseveralty in the words of his exemplar. The Lord’s Prayer in
the Codex Sangallensis is in a smaller form than this, but it bears a wonderful
affinity to it in the shape of the letter3 and even in orthography, for, though
not so reckless, it has ελθιιτω, αφιομεν, and η δυναμεις. The accompanying
faesimile (Plate ΙΙΙ.) shows some curious particulars in the form of the letters.
The B is in a transition state between Greek and Irish; the Δ, as is more fully
shown in the colophon of the second book, is on its way to an Irish ‘O ; in like
manner the A is passing to the λ, and evidences a disposition to omit the light
stroke on the left, and leave it an Irish L. The M is written in two way& the
latter of which, like two C’s dos α dos, with a vinculum, appears in the Book
of Ar1uagh0, as is shown in the annexed faesimile of the colophon to the Gos-
pel of St. Matthewv. Matthaei, not aware of

the common use of the former, writesq, concern· &ffjjm‘r- &ffvssflsve‘

The N is evidently alliud in form to the Irish &1- ι-ργβν ᾧιμιτνοκθ·

Ν; the P is interrnediate between P and R, ιμ sparti& ΟνῢᾶιτΤΗΊ “s
and the Greek influenee is shown in the Irish

capital by the tendeney to suppress the curl of the letter-3 the C for Σ is uni-
versally employed in all the Hiberno-Greek MSS. 3 the ς- is a transition from
Υ to Y, and is used in Hiberno-Latin writing for Υ, and causes the word eulo-
9z'am to appear as eyloyz'am in the Life (p. 121). On the whole, this specimen
of Hiberno-Greek‘, though worthless in alinguistie point of view, is very valu-

in the verse cited by Mabillon (Annal. Bened. Boernerianus, Animadv. p. 1 14 (Misen. 1791).
