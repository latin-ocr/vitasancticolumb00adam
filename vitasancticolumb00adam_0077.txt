gratia disponente, ut vir unitatis ae pacis studiosissimus ante ad vitam raperetur aeter-
nam, quam redeunte tempore paschali, graviorem cum eis qui cum ad veritatem sequi
nolebant, cogeretur habere discordiam.” This WaS, according to the Irish Annals, in
the year 704: in which the reformcd Eastcr feli on the 30th of March. He died on
the 23rd of Septemberk, which is the day of his commemoration both 111 the Irish and
Scotch calendars.

Of the character of Adamnan for learning and the graces of the Christian mi-
nist-ry, we have the highest testimony in the contemporary statements of Bede and
Ceolfrid. Alcuin, later in the same century, ranks him with Columba and Comgall, in
the well-known epigram1—

“ Patriam, Cheranus, Scotorum gloria gentis,
Atque Columbanus, Congallms, Adomnanus atque,

Praeelari patres, morum vitaeque magistri,
His precibus pietas horum uos adjuvet omnes.”

In a later age, Fordunm, in addition to the trite commemoration, “virtutibus pollens
et 1111111011118,Π says of his literary fidelity, “ quando historias et res gestas conscripsit,
de more semper habuit auctorem suum in testimonium ad(lucerc.” The 1rish, of
course, are loud in his praiscs. In the Vision he is styled the ‘ noble sage of the
western world‘n, and his Life ascribes to him the combined virtues of Patriarchs and
Apostles, while the Four Masters sum up the evidence thus ε “ Adamnan was a good
man, according to the testimony of St. Beda, for he was tearful, penitent‚ given to
prayer, diligent, ascetic, temperate ; he never used to eat except on Sunday and Thurs-
day; he made a slave of himself to these virtues; and, morcovcr, he was wisc and
learned in tho clear understanding of the Holy Scripttues of God.'’ th he was not
without his temptations, and there is a cmious coincidence between his Irish Life, and
the Lessons in the Breviary of Abcrdeen as to the manner in which tho enemy made
his assaults, namcly, in human form, and With knotty, diabolical questions& The phi-

this he is followed by Casimir Oudin (Comment. de
Script. Eccl. vol. i. col. 1666, Lips. 1722). Ouffln,
however, avoids two other blunders of Cave, where
the latter states that Surius published Adamnan·s
Life of St. Columba; and that Serarius was the first
editor os the tract De Locis Terroe Sanctoe.

The Irish Life states that “the demon came in hu-

Munster compelled him by force to come to Adam-
nan. And he came with many hard questions.
