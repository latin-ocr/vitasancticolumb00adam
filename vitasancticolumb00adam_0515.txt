Somerlid, the Reqzdzcs de Herer- Gaedel‘, manied a daughter of king Olaveu, the suc-
cessor of Magnus, who brought him four sons, one of whom, Dubhgall‚ was thrust into
the sovereignty of the Isles in 1 154. Consequently, a war ensued, and in 1 1 56 the strit'e
was terminated by the cession to Somcrlid and his sons of the southern islesv, includ-
ing Hy, a measure which naturally terminated the N orwegian ascendancy, and restored
the supremacy of the Celtic influence around. As a result, the¹ abbacy of Hy was
offered, in 1 164, at the instance of the king, and with the unanimous consent of the
church officials, to Flaherty O'Brolchan, the energetic abbot of Derry, who, in addition
to his dignit)v of Coarb of Columcille, had received, in 1 158, the now important quali-
fication of episcopal orders. Domestic influence prevented the offer from being accepted:
but the Irish clement, already indicated by the names of the ecelesiastical function-
aries, in 1 164, seems to have rapidly inereascd, and to the period of its development we
may possibly refer the erection of the central portion of the Cathedral. Bishop
O'Brolchain was busily employed, towards the close of the twelfth century, in re-edi-
fying the ecclesiastica] buildings of Derry; and to a kinsman of his is probably attribut-
able the oommencement of the most important structure now existing in Hy. The
unusual record on the capitalW of the tower column, noxum-s 011111111οΗ1οἻ r11e1r noc orvs,
and the coincidence of that record with the obitos Domlmull Ua Broleham in the Annals
of Ulster at 1203, and of the F our Masters at 1202, the sanie name in its Irish form, are
sufficient, if not to satisfy the mind, at least to afford material for reasonable conjee
ture, as to the builder. In 1203, Michaeb, bishop of the Isles, died at Fountain
Abbey, and was suecceded, according to the Chroniele of Man, bym'eholass, whom Torfaeus
calls Emtae-⁸⁹, observing that, for the forty years preceding, the Haebudae were without
an actual bishop; that is, that the office, as regarded the hies, was nothing more thau
titular. But 40 years, subtr-acted from 1203, bring us back precisely to the date at
which Somerlid and the clergy of Hy solicitcd the services of St. Columba's eoarb in
Derry. This Nicholas or Kolus may hare made an effert to establish his authority 111

² Her-er- &edet—chron. Mann. 1102. The name
is a form of ssipen-§nemih now Argyle, see note ¹¹¹,
p. 395, supra. Somerled is interpreted by John-
stone, ‘ Summer soldier.' as Wettrled meant ‘ winter
soldier' (Anecdotes of Olave, p. 31). It became a
favoni-ite Christian name in the Mac Donnelfamily,
and was in the sixteenth century written Sorley.
The Chron. Pict.v under Indulfus, 953-961, saysv
‘¹ Classi Somarlidiorum occisi sunt 111 Buchan,”
which Pinkerton explains Summer-people (Enq.
vol. i. p. 496, ii. p. 186). See aun. 1083, 1164.

grotesque reliefs of any in the building. Those

two bodies meeting in one head, a pair of griffins
with entwined tails, a group 01· strange animals, also
with tails entwined, and at the junction, a grotesque
head. Could these designs, so characteristic of the
Irish schooly be the Hoc opvs of Obrolchan?
