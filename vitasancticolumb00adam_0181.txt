Are we aster having been deprived of our noble:

³ Tiyhernis.—A Latin transformation os the
Irish noun cigepno, ‘ a lord‘-proving that the
δ in the word is a radica] letter-3 and pointing
to ωδ, ¹ a house‚’ as the derivation, like dominus
from domus, rather than to τύραννος, which
O’Brien proposes In the narrative these
princes are called reqii generis viri and no-
In the Lives of the Irish Saints
Dux is the usual representative of the word.
The founder of Clones was called Tiyhernaclz‚
“quia multorum dominorum et regum nepos
est.'' (Act. 88. Apr. tom. i. p. 401.) The word
appears in the old Welsh form of tiyirn, and the
Cornish teyrn, as also in the proper names
Guertlziyem, Eutiyeru, Tim-nan, Maeleiern.
(Zeuss, Gram. Celt. i. pp. 100, ¹5¹. 158, 162.)
So Kentigern is interpreted Capitalis Dominus.
(Pinkert. Vit. Ant. p. 207.)

Slane, county of Meath. (Four Mast. 830;
Calend Dungall. Mar. 9.)

of its town Carrickmacross, which derives its
name from the same source‚-the former being

Commio moofflpe ΠοιΓ, Rupes campi Rossio-
rum. (Ord. Surv. Monaghan, s. 31.) The
surrounding territory was formerly called Ros
or Cricl. Rois, and the inhabitants Feara Rois.
The monastery spoken of in the text is men-
tioned in the Annals of t'lster (A. C. 826, 846:
Four Mast. 825. 845), under the tribe name
Fer Rois, where the obits of two Priors are
recorded. Subsequently it became a pai-ish
chureh, and appears iu the Ecclesiastical Tax-
ation ofClogher, circ. 1300, as Ecclesia de Ros.

the south-western portion of the barony of

from his descendants Cpit} Ulussoopno, now

adjoining Farney on the north. Sometimes it
was called Πῖυδΰοῐιηο ΠἸωδιη. In St. Pa-
