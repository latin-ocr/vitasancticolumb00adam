Alsemoz'r of St. Adamnan. xli
the parish or province which gave him birth, there is good reason for supposing that
he was a native of that part of the territory occupied hythe race of 00111111, called Tir-
Aedhah, and now familiarly known as the barony of Tirhugh, in the south-west of the
count-y of Donegal. Here was settled the elan from which he sprung, and here was
also one of 1115 principal commemorations‘, preserving a vivid recollection of his abode&
His father, Ronan¹, was sixth in desc-ent from Conall Gulbanm, the head of one of the
two great raees of the N orthem Ity-N 6111, and, in virtue of his birth, claimed kin to
St. Columba, and many of the sovereigns of Ireland. The father of Bonan was Tinne,
from whom came the patronymic Ua Pirenen, or ‘grandson of Tinne‚’ an appellative
which is occ-asionally found coupled with Adamnan‘s name. Romae, the mother of
Adamnan, was desoended from Enna, a son of Niall, whose race, tho Cz'uel Enna, pos-
sessed themselves of the tract lying between the channels of the Fo5le and Swilly,
which was called the Tir-Enna, or ‘ land of Enna,’ and answers to the modom barony

of Raphoe.

bur. mor-⁹, the Chron. Scotnr. reads 56111, notit-1⁴-
tas. Lanigan (Eccles. Hisr„ iii. p. 153) prefers the
date 627, because he finds the age of 77 assigned to
Adamnan, and 6244 77 only equal to 701, whereas
704 is the date of his death. Mae Firbis’s MS. An-
nals erate his age at 78 ; the date, however, as given
in the Annals, is not to be hastily set nside. Ward
aesigns his birth to 626 (Rumold, p 218).

¹² Te'r-Aedlzu.—That is, ‘the land of Aedh,' so
called from Aedh, son of Ainmire, who, in common
with Adamnan, was of the Siol Setina, or descend-
ants of Sedna, grandson of Conall Gulban (Geneal.
Table, p. 342), one branch of whom, namely, the
OEnel Luighdech, occupied the present barouy of
Kilmaerenan (p, 192), and another, the barony of
Tirhugh (p. 38).

¹ Cmnmemoratiom.-T11e chnreh of Drumhome,
of which Adamnan was patron. See the interesting
mention of it at p. 238, where it is almost implied
that Adnmnan was, in his boyhood, living in that
neighbourhood.

k Recollection oshis abode.—Ward, in reference
to a well in the parish of Drumhome, says : “Vidi
qui ex loco quodam Dabhaclz Adamlmain, ubi
Sanetus pernoctabat in aquis, vimina ad restem
nendum abstulisset, contemptis Sancti nomine et
asylo, et mox rabiosa febre correptus, eadem
nocte interiit furibundus, exiliens manibus grabato,

Here was situate the ancient church of Rath-bothv, said to have been

uti quodam agitatus daemone.” In the marginal
note he explains Dablmch Adamhnain by Lava-
crum Adamnani, and adds “clarus miraculis fons
in Tirconallia inter Dungalliam et Belathseniam
(Bauyshannon)‚ in quo pernox stabat.”—Vardaei
Rumoldus, p. 219.
