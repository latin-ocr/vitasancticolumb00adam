Fi-:w names, in passing from their real 1ο 111011 phonetic forms, have undergone such
tmnsfoimafions as that of our author. Who would suppose that Adammm and Euncm
were intended for the same person, 01 that Adampnanus and Thezcnan were resch-able
into a common original? Adamnan is an Irish diminutive of Adam, as Cormac inter-
prets 1110 word in his Glossary : GoomNGN ,1. 11011111115011111Γ, 111Γῦ00οὑ (11111111
(mmm, ‘ Amasis, i. e. komzchzdus, a diminutive of the name Adam.‘ Under the
effect of 351111311οῃ, Gemi] loses the force of 115 eonsonants, and assumes the various
sounds of Αιι, Ea, O, and On: hence, when the diminutive termination is added, it
produces the respective words Aurum& Emzanb‚ Omm⁰, Ozman: these are the forms of
pronunciation which the name Adanman has assumed in Ireland.

1n the north-east of Scotland, as in Aberdeen and Banff, 11101015 a tendency to
prefix certain consonants to saints’ names, either asan equivalent for St„ or 1ο facilitate
the pronunciation. Thus St. Rule becomes Trozcel, and St. Antony Τ antan⁶; and hence
Eunan becomes T heuman, as in the pai-ish of Aboynee, where a fresh change takes place,
and St. Adamnan’s Weu and Tree become Skezclan Wall, and Skeulan Trea. Agajn, at
Forvey, in the parish of Slains‘, Adamnan becomes F adamnan,- and in Forgleng, Adam-
nan's church is Telmun E'z'rk. But, at Dullh in Athon, the form Eomm is preserved,
as at Kilcherran in Cantyrc, where we find the compound Kz‘llezcnmze or Killownanei.

The consequence of this dix-ersity in the written and spoken forms of the name has
been that even 1110 best writers have created one or 111010 additional saints, and have
put the acts of Adamnan in commission. Thus, in Ireland, Sir J ames XVare represents.
Raphoe as founded by Columba, rcpaired by Adamnan, and changed from an abbey to
a cathedra] by St. Eunan, “who is looked upon to be the first Bishop of the see’ff.
