ὴ Crztlhinipopuli.—Cpuichne, the Irish Picts,
a name frequently given to the Dal-Araidhe.
They inhabited the southern half of the county
of Antrim, and the greater part of the county
of Down, and their territory was sometimes
called opio ηα enumhne, ⁵ region ofthe Picts.'
Mons Mis, or Shobh mur, now Slenzz‘sh, a re-
markable hill in the centre of the county of
Antrim, is placed by the Book of Armagh
(fol. 3 α α), and the Second and Fourth Lives
of S. Patrick in Colgan's collection (Tr. Th.
pp. 14, 39), *ί in regionibus Cruidnenorum.”
Fiacha Araidhe, who gave name to the Dal
Araidhe, was, according to Tighernaeh, lord
of the Cruithne in 236.—Book of Lecan, fol.
¹40 b, 141 α, ¹94 a b; O‘Flaherty, Ogyg. iii. 18

tion of the Cruithnii at i. 7. and 36, and draws
the distinction which is generally observed in
the Annals of Ulster‚ calling the Irish Picts
Cruithuizg and the Scottish, Picti or Pictores.
The Life of St. Comgall says : ‘⁸ De aquilonali
Hiberniae regione, nomine Dail-naraidhe‚ quae
est contra mare in aquilonali provinciae plaga
Ultorum, sanetus abbas Comgallus ortus fuit.’'
(Cod. Kilken. fol. 90 b ⁴13 Fleming, Collect. p.
303.) According to his pedigree he was ninth
in descent from Fiacha Araidhe⁷ the founder of
the race; while Congal Claen, who commanded
the Dalaradians in this battle, was tenth in de-
sceut from the same individual. For the his-
tory of Congal Claen, see O'Donovan's Battle
of Magh Rath, pp. 22, 34, etc. For the place
os St. Comgall's birth. see Reeves' Eccl. Antiqq.
p. 269.

*Manitio Cetlzirni.—The Latin equivalent
for Oun Cezclnpn, Dun Kehern. This fortress
derived its name from Cethern¹ son of Fintan,
one of the famous heroes of the Red Branch
who flourished in Ulster about the Christian
era. His grandfather Niall Niamhglonnach
[⁴of the shining deeds'], son of Ross Ruadh,
son of Rudhraighe, ancestor of the Clanua Rury,
had his residence, about five miles eastwaffls,
in the majestie earthen fort over the Banu,
anciently called Dun-da-bheann [Fort of the
two peaks], and now known as Mountsandal,
near the Cutts of Coleraine. (Cathreim Con-
ghail Clairingnech, p. 12, MS. R,1r. Acad.)
Cethern, the founder of Dun Ceithern, oecupies
a* prominent place in the ancient historical ro-
mance called the Tain-bo-Cuailgne, in which
he is represented as coming from Dun-da-
bheann (Book of Leinster, fol. 62 α a); and
again as sent for to Carn Loig [Four Mast.
