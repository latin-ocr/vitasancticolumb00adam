‘Ross Finnchuill was its first name, aud Esgar
Brannain is its name now, from Brannan the
poet. And he spoke the poem:

Ross Finnchuill of Clunin Diothrach.
Where youths and greyhountls used to bev
Was a dark wood, τοῖα] its gifts,
For the hunting uf Dathi Mic Fiachrach.

Beibhinn. the daughter of powesful Briau.
Wus the mother of Dathi mac Fiachrach
It was she, as Ι have heard here,
Who obtained the Mendows round the fair Ross.

The Esgir of Brunnan. son of Euchaidh,
The grave of Conn of the hundred battles,
Wus a dark nuk-forest mitil now,
For the ehase of Finncuill of elan-Diothrajgh.·

A chureh, called Lann Maeldubh from Fintan
Maeldubh, is described as situate between

Ross-na-righ and the Boyne (Book of Lein-
ster). Or, as iu the Naemlzsenclaas, Fintan,

and Maeldubh of Leitir-Maelduibh at Ros—na-
rig. (Lib. Lecan.) And the Life of st. Finnian
states that previously to his fixing his seat at
Clonard he founded a church at Escar-Branain‚
which (and not Clonard, as Colgan sayS, Aet.
SS. p. 398 b, n. 23) was anciently called Ros-
Finchoill.-cap. 16 (Act. SS. p. 394 b).

b Christi miles.—This expression is sre-
quently used by Adamnan in reference to the
monastic profession. We find acmes), from
loeo, miles, as an ecclesiastical term in An.
Ult. 1110. The same word occurs iu the argu-
ment of the Feilire, which Colgan paraphrases
“qui ex saeculi milite miles Christi factus.’'
(Act. SS. p. 579 b.) The expression moine
emm: of Tigh. 729, is Christi miles in An. Ult.
728. See Tigh. 738.

ε Luyudius filius Tailchar1i.—The Calendars
commemorate ἰυδωῠ ruccone, ‘ Lughaidh
the presbyter,' at Mar. 2. whom Colgan iden-
tifies with the above, and devotes a chapter
to, at the same day (Act. SS. p. 452), but. ad-
duces no fresh information. A Tailehanus is
mentioned in i. 2 (p. 23) supra, but he cannot
be the same as the present Tailehanus, for the
son of the former was juvenis subsequently to
the time that the son ofthe latter was a senez·-
This is one of the few cases where the Calend-
ars fail to assist us.

d lemnam-Called Virynons further on.
We find the Irish name Pepssnu similarly
latinized in cap. 19 (p. 225) supra. Colgan sup-
poses that this was the Feargua, afterwards
