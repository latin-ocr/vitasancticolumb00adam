2 [qiman—In this manner the Life of St. Mar-
tin and many other early biographies com-
mence. Cummincus' short life of our saint
begins so; and C. D. F .S., which are followed
by Caffisius, Messingham, and Pinkerton, make
this the commeneement of chap. 1. The pro-

ties, was owing the immense influence which
he possessed, and the consequent celebrity of

his conventual establishments: in fact, he en-

joyed a kind of spiritual monarchy collaterally

with the secular dominion ofhis relatives, being
sufficiently distant in Iona to avoid collision,
yet near enough to exercise an authority made
up of the patriarchal and monastic. His imme-
diate lineage stands thus :—
