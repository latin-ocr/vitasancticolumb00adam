Blemoz'r of St. Aelamnan. liii

the soul of Adaman desired to remm'n in the happy region, but that “it heard from
behind him, through the vess, the voice of his guardian. angel commanding it to be
replaced in the same body from which it had passed; aud that it should relate in the
assemblies and convcntions of the laity and clergy the rewards of heaven and the pains
of hell, such as the conducting angel had rcvealed to him. It was therefore the pre-
cept which Adamnan preached whilst he was alive. ‘It was this precept, too, whieh
was preached in the great convention of the men 01· Erin, when Admnnan's Rule was
put on the Gacdhil; and when women were made fiee by Adamnan and Finachta
Fledaehz son of Dunehadh, son of Aedh 51111110, the King ot' Erin, and by the men ot'
Erin also. For it was 11111ςο that men and women went into battlcs and into conflicts‚
until the the Rule of Adamnan was imposed.” A second vision, or rather a supple—
ment, recounting the wickednesses of the inhabitants of Ireland, and the mortalities
with which they were visited, and should be w'sited, follows, and mentions such
chastisements as the Scamlmclz, or ‘ Leprosy;' the Βο-αν, 01 ‘Cow mortality; the Dz'qbae'l
tamid, 01· ⁴ Bh'ght of fruit3y the Gorta, or ‘Famine ;’ the sza, or ‘ Seareityff and
Dum'badh, or ‘ Human mortality ;' against au of whieh it declares prayer and fasting to
be the only sure preservative..

From 697 till the year of his death, Adamnan seems to have remained iu Ireland:
for, though the social improvement which he effected is despatched in a few words in
the Annals, we can hardly conceive that so vital a measure was brought about without
much exertion and preparatory solicitation. The success of his paschal advoeacy among
a people naturally attached to old p1·ejudieeS‚ in eommunitics widely spread, and sub-
ject to many antagonistic influenees, must have required a longer period for its 00111-
pletion than the following words of Bedeu would at first sight seem to imply: “ Navi—
gavit Hiberniam, et praedicans eis, ac modesta exhortatione declarans legitimum
paschae tempus, plurimos eorum, et pene omncs qui ab Hiieusium dominio erant
liberi, ab errore avito correctos ad unitatem reduxit catholicam, et legitimum paschae
tempus observare perdocuit.” The Life of St. Gerald of Mayo, a compilation fun of
anachronisms, has yet this curicus coincidence with the statement just made, that it
allows Adamnan a seren years' rcsidence in Ireland. N ow, admitting the supposition
above stated to be correct, the interval between 697 and 704, the year of Adamnaurs
death is exactly commensurate with this period. One thing appears certain from
Bede, namely, that Adamnan crossed over from Ireland to Hy 111 the summer of the
year iu which he died, and that 110 had been in Ireland for a considerable time pre·
viously. The Irish Annals record an occurrence which almost proves him to have
been in Ireland in 70¹· In that year Irgalach. 5011 of Conang, great-grandson cf
