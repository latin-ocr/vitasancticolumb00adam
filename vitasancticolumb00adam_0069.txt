Elsemoir of St. Adamnan. xlix

King Finnachta, had ineurred, if the bardic accounts are to be eredited, the displeasure
of the Hy Neill race, by impairing the honours which he was expected to uphold, in
remitting to the Leiuster-men the tribute which they had been in the habit of annually
paying to the chief of the existing dynasty. Finnachta had fought the ingenians and
routed them, so that his indulgence to them does not seem to have been extmted by
force. The secret probably lies 10 thc monareh‘s title of Fledaelz, or ‘ the Festive.⁷
Poems ascribe the exemption to the pleading of St.. Moling, a Leinster ecclesiastic of
great eelebrity, who took advantage of the ambiguous meaning of the word Luan,
which is either llffindags, or the day ofjudyment, to convert the ‘term of a temporary
respitc into a perpetual surrender of the claim. Adamnan gets the credit of being the
great ehampion for the maintenance of the demand3 and a poemx of some length and
fire is attributed to him, wherein 110 03115 Finnaehta 111 1¹¹3 epm hoe een oecu, ‘the
old grey king without teeth,’ and indulges in such sentiments as these :—

“ Were I a king of reddened spears
I would humble mine enemies,
I would exalt my high places,
My combats should be frequent.'⁷

The Irish Life of Adamnan says that a proclamation had been made by Finnachta to
the effect, that the lands of Columcille should not enjoy the same privileges as those
of Patrick, Finnian, and Ciaran, whereupon Adamnan said: ‘⁴ The life of the king
who made this proclamation shall 00 short; he shall fall by fratricide3 and there shall
be no king of his raee for ever.’' Finnachta fell by the hand of his cousin in 69 ς.
During his sojourn in Ireland, Adamnan 'm au probability exerted himself strenu-
ously in the propagation of the new Easter observance, and laid the foundation of the
great success which afterwards attended his recommendation of the subject in this
his native country. His stay, however, was not of long eontinuance, for we find him
returm'nq to Ireland in 697, in order to legislate for the people. It was probably in
the interval of these two journeys that he eornpiled his Life of St. Columba, for the
use of his society. In it 110 makes 110 reference to the differenee of sentiment between
himself and his congregation on the paschal question; but there is an allusion to a
sore subject, where he tells of St. Columba's propheey at Clonmacnoise concerning the
discord, “quoe post dies multos ob diversitatem Paschalis festi orta est inter Seotiae
eeclesias” (p. 26). He may have referred to the same subject when he spoke of the
“ valde stolidi qui ingrati Dei patientia male abutuntuf’ (p. 184). Baert conjectured
that the Life was written during Adamnan's last sojourn 111 Ireland, and that the
brethren, at whose instance he professes to write, were not the refractory monks of
Hy, but the more 3111003010 inmates of Durrow, and of the kindred associations in
