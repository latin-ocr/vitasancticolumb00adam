held in veneration by the other sex (112, 159, 163), there can be no doubt that celi-
bacy was strictly enjoined on his community, and the condition, “virgo
corpore et virgo mentc''5, held up for imitation. Hence we find a monk
discharging an office usually assigned to women (125)y and hence the total
absence of anything like hereditary suecession in the abbaey of Hy. A learned and
ingenious writer in a modern jomnal¹ has proved to a demonsssrafion, from the native
Annalists, that a lineal succession of abbots existed in many of the In'sh monasteries
during the ninth and following centuries, but he has failed to include the coarbs of Co-
lumba in the class; and a comparison of his premises with the Genealogical Table
which accompam'es this Note will show that he. has mistaken names for per80n30. Mar-
riagc, no doubt, existed among the secular clergy⁸, but the practice seems to have been
‹lisapproved of by the regulare: and thus we may qualify the story told of St. Com-
gall's preceptor: “Quadam noete cum Clericus ille eum muliere dormisset”¹²; and
Adamnan’s narrative of the clericus of Magh Breg, “dives et honoratus in plebe,'⁷ who
died “ cum meretrice in eodem lectulo cubans⁷' (7 5).

Iu their intercourse with one another, the monks of this order appear to have been
xii-mally rcgulated by the precept of Columbanus, “ Cum cautela et ratione loquendum
Of such reserve the anecdote told of the monks and Baithene (72)
ramur-nitas. affords an example. Between the abbot and the brethren there seems to

have been 110 restraint (168, 208) ; and as regards the society at large, the
objects of their system were too practical, and their engagements too much character-
izcd by common sense, to impose any restraint in conversation but such as conduced
to the purity or decorum of the members.

Another monastic principle was Humility‚ which was exemplified both in de-
meanour towards superiors, and in dejection after sin. A visitor ou bended knees

bowed down before the founder (203), and his successor (20); and even
[mamintus. before a subordinate senior the brethren made known their wishes upon their
knces (72). The penitent fell on his knees weeping (59). St. Benedict’s
