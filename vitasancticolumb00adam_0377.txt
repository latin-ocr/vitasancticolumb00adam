Libren‘, Senan. eomely eomas-hg,
The son of Ua Cheinh, and 1118 brother&
Are the four, besides the others,
Who shafl aurive at this place.
They are the seven pillars,
And they are the seven ehiefs,
Whom God has surely commanded
To dwell 111 1110 same abode.

Three years, without light, was
Colum 111 1118 Black Chureh:
He passed to angels from 1118 body,
After seven years [and] sevcnty.

· This chumh, like the Sabhull at Saul and Armagh, is recorded to have stood north
and south; and the remains of it, which existed in 1520, were referred to by O'Don-
nell 111 proof of the factm. In 1110 fourteenth century it was called 1110 Cella Nchsra de
Derz'au. Its Round Tower was standing in the seventeenth century, but the only local

record of its existence now remaining 18 the name of the lane which leads to 118 site,
the Lonq Sleeple. It is descrving of notice that Ffflehadh, 8011 of Ciaran, 8011 of Ain-
mire, son of Sedna, whose death 18 recorded by Tighernaeh at 620, is described by the
annalist as alius fundatorum Daire s'alyaz'ch. He was nephew of Aedh, son ot'Ainmire‚
the reputed founder. This entry, and thc authorities cited at p. 160, supra, arc suffi-
cient to vindjeate O'Donncll's statements, eonceming the donation of Derry, from the
objections urged ’1111110 Ordnance Memoir of Templemore0. This admirable work, how-

sepultus est in Daurmaig¹¹ of p. 247, supra. The
concurreuce of these two testimonies is remarkable
in the ease of a person whose name is not found in
the Calendars, Annals, or other authority now ac-

cessible. An uudesigned coincidence such as this
invests both with great historieal credit.
