·· ‘ 23. Compare Bede, H. E. iv. 23. The Irish
word is eloco or 0105, akin to the English
clock. Some ecelesiastica] bells as old as the
time of St. Columba are preserved in Ireland.
They are formed of sheet iron, bent into a.
four-sided form, like the modern bullock-bells
of Spain, and the sheep-belis of Wiltshire,
fastened with rivets, and brazed. One of the
most original passages in the legends of the
Breviary of Aberdeen occurs in the office of
St. Lughaidh or Moiuoc, an Irisbman, the
founder of the Scotch Lismore, who died in
592 : “ Sed et (lie quadam cumserream campa-
nam et quadratam sue ecclesie pernecessariam
fabricandam haberet.”-—Proprium SS. Part.
Estiv. fol. 6 ιια. Th'e quadrangular bell of
St. Gall, the Irish missionary to Switzerland,
who died circ. 646, is preserved in the monas-
tery of the city which bears his name, but per-
verted from its original design by being attached
to a wall, sor all the ancient Irish belis were
hand-bells. Though the accommodation of
such belis was only one of the purposes for
which the Round Towers served, yet they pro-
cui-ed for those peculiar structures the name of
Cimo-Ceae, or “ bell-house.' For drawings of
ancient bells see St. Patrick's Bell (Beffast,
1850); Ulster Journal of Arehaeol. vol. i. pp.

whether this refers to Aidan's Scots, or to the

Miathi as his allies; and whether the term
barbari, which follows, is applicable to the lat-
ter, or to a common foe. Cummineus, however,
from whom the substance of the anecdote is
copied, expressly says, “pro Aidano et populo
ejus.''—cap. 25. (Act. SS. Bened. Ord. i. p.
346; Colgan, Tr. Th. p. 324 a.) So Fordun
also.—Scotichr. iii. ²9·

s Aidauo.—Hib. (leben, a diminutive of Get').
See Zeuss, Gram. Celt. i. p. 281. “AEdan rex
Scottorum qui Brittaniam inhabitant-''—Bede,
H. E. i. 34. ⁸‘Aegthan,'’ Sax.Chron. 603. See
next chap. and i. 49, iii. 5.

ἕ Bellmn.—Fordun copies this chapter almost
verbatim, and identifies the subject of it with
the battle os Wodenysburgh, which was fought,
according to the Saxon Chronicle, in 591· He
places it near Chester, whither Aedan marched
to the support of Cadwalla, the British king.
(Sco‘tichr. iii. 29.) But such a supposition is
inadmissible, if the identity of the Miathi and
Maeatae be allowed. Ussher proposes “the
battle of Lethrigh by Aedan the son of Gabh-
ran,’' which Tighernach records at 590, and
Ann. Ult. at 589; and subsequent writers adopt.
the suggestion, especially Chalmers, who makes
it history, and, on his own authority, fills up

⁴ the blanks : ‘¹ In fighting, again, in support of

the Britons, he defeated the Saxons, in 590, at
the battle of Leithredh, when his two sons,
Arthur, and Eoohwfiu, were, however, slain,
with rather more than three-hundred men.'’
