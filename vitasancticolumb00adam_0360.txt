The Annals of Inisfailen have hep, in the genitive, seven times; Iae Coluim-cillffl,

Tho Annals of Boyle also have [αἱ .

An these Annals contain mixed texts; that 15, 111 which Latin and Irish are inter-
woven, and Irish names are occasionally subjected to Latin inflexion.

The F our Masters purport to exhibit a purely Lrish text, but sometimes borrow the
Latim‘zed names from the earlier records. Thus, they have loe after abb seventeen

Ha or Ηιια as his substantive. Cummine Ailbe, ciro. 660, employs in his Life of St.
Columba Ioua insulae, the expression adopted by Adamnan. Ven. Bede, on the other
hand, uses H'e'ffi from which he forms the adj eotive Hz‘iensisg. In like manner, Ii and
Hz'i aro found in the Sason Chronjdeh. Waiafridus Strabo, 0110. 831, using a form
which, as has beon observed, occurs 01100 111 'righer-nach, designatos tho island as
