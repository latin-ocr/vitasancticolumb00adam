Ireland. and died in 598. See uoto Ε, p. 39, sn-
pra. There is a good deal of uneertainty as
to the year of 1115 accession, but if the (late of
the convention of Druimeeatt given iu the An-
nals of Ulster be correct, he was sovereign
before 575.

ς Aidanifilii Gubhrani.—He succeeded to the
lordship ofthe Scotch Dalriada in 574, aud pos-
sessed sufficient power and address not only to
secure the independence of his race, but to lay
the foundation of that supremacy which it af-
terwards acquired in Seotland The account
ot' his inauguration by St. Columba⁷ and the so-
lemn charge 119 received not 10 11101951 1119 sub-
jects of the Irish King, are given iu iii. 5, infra.
Immediately (111 1115 elevation he seems to have
aspired to the forming an independent king·
dom, and to have renounced all subjection to
the Irish monarch ς nay, as some assert, he went
50 far as to claim jurisdiction over the parent
Dalriada. The Irish mmmrch, on the other
hand, laid claim to the tributas and service os
the Scotch Dalriada as a colony which was
bound to the mother country. To make 311
amicable adjustment of these differences was a
principa] object sor which the convention of
Druimceatt was held, and 575, 1119 year aster
Aidan's accession, was that in which it took
place. The matter iu controversy and the
award are stated in the prefaces to the Amhra,
as follows ·.-“ Τ119 Dal Riada were those about
whom there was a contention between the men
of Alba and the men of Erin3 because they
were both of the race of Cairbre Righfada, that
is, os the men of Munster. For, upon the occa-
sion of 3 great famine which came upon Mun—
ster, the descendants of Cairbre Righsada left
it, and 0119 party of them went to Alba, and the

other party staid in Erin, from whom are the
Dalriada at this day. They took root after-
wards 111 111059 territories, till the time of
Aedhan mac Gabhrain, King of Alba, and of
Aedh mac Ainmire, King of Eriu. And a con-
test arosc between those two kings about them.
And that was one cf the three causes for which
Columcille came to Erin, 10 make peace be-
tween the men os Erin and of Alba, namely,
about Dal Riada. When he came to the meet-
ing, Colman 5011 of Comgellan [whom St. Co-
lumba. when departing from Ireland sor Hy,
had met as aboy near Celemnae, and who sub-
sequently died in 625—Ti9l1.] accompanied him,
and Columkille was requested to givejudgment
between the men of Erin and Alba. lt is not 1
that shall give it, said 119, but yonder youth,
pointing to Colman mac Comgellain. Colman
then gave judgmeut3 and the decision that 119
gave was: Their expeditio-ns and hostings to be
with the men of Erin always, for hostings al-
ways belong to the parent stock. Their tri-
butesss and gains, and shipping‚ to be with the
men of Alba. And when one of the 111911 of
Erin or Alba should come from the east, the
Dal Riada to entertain them, whether few or
many: and the Dal Riada to convey them on,
if they require it.'‘ (Leabhar 113 hUidhre⁷ fol. 8 ;
H. 2, 16, Trin. Coll. Dubl.; Highlaud Soc. MS.
fol. 13 α ὁ.) To the same purport also O'Dou-
nell, iii. 10 (Tr. Th. p. 432 b); Keating‚ Hist.
(Reg. Aedh). The result was, as O’Flaherty
succinctly states: “ 111 quo conventu Aidanus

buto, adeoque liberi, absolutique principatus
eminentiam adeptus 951.” (Ogyg. p. 475.) Ac.
