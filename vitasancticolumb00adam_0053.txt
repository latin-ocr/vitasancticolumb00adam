patris ιιιί, et vade in terram qaam tibi monstravero. This curious relic of
Irish preaehing is preserved in four manuscripts 2—1. The Leabhar Breac, or
Speckled Book of Mac Egan, in the library of the Royal Irish Academy (fol.
1 5 ab). 2. The Book of Lismore (fol.49 b a), ofwhich the original is in the pos-
session of his Graee the Duke ofDevonshire‚ and a beautiful copy in the Royal
Irish Academy. 3. A quarto vellum MS„ formerly belonging to the Highland
Societye of Scotland, and now deposited in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh.
It is a thin fasciculus without covers, probably of the twelfth century, and
written in double columns. The Life begins in fol. 7, and is continued to the
end, namely, 14 b. It modernizes all the old words and constructione of the
earlier copies, and subjoins the account of St. Columba’s proceedings at the
convention of Drumeeatt, taken from one of the prefiiees to the Amhra Cho-
luim-cille. This MS. may be the one of those mentioned by Martius, circ.
1700: “ The Life of columbus, written in the Irislz Character, is in the Cus-
tody of John Mac& Neil, in the Isle of lim-ray ; another Copy of it is kept by
stlack-Dorzald of Be7zbecztla.” A sacsimile of some lines has been engraved
in one ofthe Highland Society's publicationsb'. 4. MS. Royal Library‚ Paris¹¹‚
Ancien Foud„ No. 8175. It fimus fol. 53 aa to fol. 56 hb, of a small folio
parchment volume found by the Revolutionary Commissioners, during the
Republic, in a private house in Paris, and by them presented to the library.

This ancient Life, evidently held in great esteem‚ furnished O'Donnell with
a considerable portion of his narrative, and he has transferred the whole into
his collection. Usshcr was acquainted with it, as is shown by his referencei:
“Ut habet anonymus, qui acta ipsius Hibernico idiomate descripsit ;” but
Colgan does not seem to have been aware of its existence, and the Irish Life
which he cites is always that of O'Donnell.
