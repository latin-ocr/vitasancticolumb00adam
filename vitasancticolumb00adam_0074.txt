Aedh Slaine, and lord of Cianaehtav in Meath, slew his own cousin NialL son of
Ceamaeh Sotal. This act is said to have excited the indignation of Adauman, under
whose protection Niall had been, and he denounced against Irgalach speedy retribu-
tion for the crime. At this time Adamnan is represented to have been in the neigh-
bourhood of the Boynem and an ancient poem¹ states that the cursing of Irgalaeh took
place in a synod held by Adamnan at Tara. Irgalaeh, according to Tighernach‚ was
slain by the Britons in 70²3 and the Annals of Ulster add that the deed was done in
Inis-mac-Ncsan, the small island east of Howth, now known as Ireland’s Eye. The
wife of Irgalaohr was Muirenn, daughter of Cellach Cualann, and sister of St.. Kenti-
gerna² of Loch Lomond. She. died 111 748.

The Life of St. Geraldus⁹ represents Adamnan’s connexion with Mayo in these
words z “ Tunc sanctus abbas Adamnanus post visitationem totius Hiberniae ad S. Ge-
raldum perrexit, ut fraternam 011111 00 contraheret societatem. Cui S. Geraldus fundum
011111 fonte limpido eontulit, atque sibi suam commendavit Ecclesiam, ut a persecutione
laicorum post obitum suum eam defenderet: quod totum S. Adamnanus se comple—
turum promisit, atque opere complevit. Post ejus [S. Geraldi] vero obitumh S. Adam-

* Lora of cinnamum—So he 15 styled in the
Cain ΑάὴιιηιηαίπἼ although he could not have been
lord by descent, as the Cianachta were of a different
race from his. The Annals of Im'sfallen call him
“king of Hy Neill,” which is probably correct, as
his son Ciouaedh was monarch of Ireland from 724
to 728. Dr. Petrie states that 'rignei-uach calls
lorgalach “ king of Bregia‘’ (Tam, p. 148); but
this must be a mistake, or else the printed text has
omitted the title. It is also an error to say that he
was killed by the Samus. In 682 the Britons
fought with the Dalaradjans at Rathmor, and 111
697 they joined the Ulidians iu wasting the coast of
Louth (pp. 377, 37 8, infra). Possibly they had
made a settlement 111 Ireland.

w Remum—The Irish Life of Adamnan represents
the saint as “sasting against Irgalach,'' immersed
in the river Boiun⁷ aud uvercoming him by deecit.
This system ofsastiny ayaimt an obnoxious indivi-
dual was a savourite mode with the Irish ecclesias—
tics of bringing down visitations on their 0110111105.
T he Brehon Laws contain directions on the course
which is to be pursued in such a case. Irgalach re-
sisted the influence of St. Adamnan’s fasting by
doing the same himself, until Adamnan. by induc-
ing one of his people to personate him, put Irgalach

off his guard, aud thus got the mastery of him.
The story is curicus. not only as illustrative of this
extraordinary system of tasting, but as iudicating
the low tone of moral feeling in the writer who re-
presents the saint as saying: ‘⁴ Itis better that one
of his people should tell a falsehood for him, than
that. he should tell it himselffi

5 er of hydam—The Irish Life says that
“she was humble and obedient to the Lord and to
Adamnan 3” and it is remarkable that her obit is
entered in the Annals, which is very rarely done in
the case of women.
