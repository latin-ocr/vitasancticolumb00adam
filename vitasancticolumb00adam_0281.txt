Post eandem trans—
actam noctem diluculo mane consurgimus, et videntes cessasse contrarios
flatus, conscensis navibus, nullo flante vento, in mare progredimur¹¹‚ et eece
statim post nos auster cardinalis, qui et ¹³n0tus⁰‚ inflat. Tum proinde ovantes
nautae vela ¹⁴subrigunt: sieque ea die talis, sine labore, nostra tam festina na-
vigatio, et tam prospera, beato viro donante Deo, fuit, ut sicuti prius exopta-
vimus, post horam diei tertiam? ad Iouae portum pervenientes insulaeq, postea

coin} so named from Boetan, great-grandson
of Loarn Mor. The rural deanry, which is
the best evidence of the original extent of the
lordship on which it was modelled, included
the parishes of Kilmartin, Craignish. Kilchat-
tan, Kilbrandon, Kilmelford, Kilniuver, Kil-
bride, Kilmore, Kilchrenan, Inishail, Muckairn,
Glenorchy, Ardebattan, Lismore, and Appin,
that is, the portion of the present county of
Argyll lying north and west of Loch Awe, ex-
tending to Loch Leven on the north, and the
Crinan Cana] on the south-west. See 1nnes,
Orig. Par. ii. 1, pp. 91-159. The Genus Gab-
mm' has been mentioned by Adamnan, cap. 22
(p. 132) supra.

k Saineam insulam—Now Shumz⁸ an island
in the parish of Kilchattan, lyiug close to

η Luing on the east, and separated from it by the

Sound of Shuna. It is situate in Nether Lorne¹
near its southern extremity. The contrary
wind which delayed them there was probably a
north-west one, but they were in safety on the
sheltered side of Luing. Fordun writes the
name Sunay. (Seotichr. ii. ιο.) There is another
Shuna off Appin, on the north of Lismoro, but
it is too far up to suit the present descripti0n;
still more so is Shona‚ off Moydart.

'Festive noxa—The choice between 59⁶ and
597, as the year of St. Columba's death, depends,
Ahp. Ussher says upon the determination of
the question, “num nox illa media, qua Co-
lumba decessisse diximus, diem Junii nonum

Η submergunt Boll.

vel inchoaverit vel finierit.'' (Wks. vi. p. 235)
The present expression favours inchoaverit,
and thus indicates the latter year.

¹¹· A Domino impetrare—The following chap-
ter has, ⁴⁴ orante pro nobis nostro venerabili
patrono.” In i. 1 (p. 13) supra, he speaks ofthe
Saint as a “ victorialis et fortissimus propug-
nator.” The existence of a belief in the minis-
tration and intercession of deceased saints in
temporal matters is clearly indicated in the
three concluding chapters os this book. St.
Columba was invoked, dur-inq his Izsetime, from
remote places. See ii. 5 (p. ιη), 13 (p. ιη),
39 (p. 161), 40 (163), supra.

¹¹ In mare progredimur.-—-That is, by rowing.
Presently, on getting clear ofthe isIands, ¹¹ nau-
tze vela subrigunt.‘¹

⁰ Notus.—Shuna lies E. S. Ε. of Hy.

ν Post horam tertiam—They were within a
sortnight ofthe longest day ; and ifthey started
at three in the morning, diluculo mane, the
journey might have been accomplished in six
hours: that iS, supposing them to have arrived
at nine. But the present expression allows a
longer time, sor it only asserts that the cano-
nical “ tertia hora⁷' was past.

ἢ Portum insulae.-See note b, ἰ. 30 (p. 58)
supra. If they chose to disembark at the
nearest landing-plaoe, Port-a-churaich was
the one which they would choose. See Mup.

lebrated soon after “mane prim0'’ by St. Cu-
