31115 3150 some examples of the Greek handae which was then in vogue among the
Irish. It was a common practice with them to write Latin matter in Greek letters*

(89, 187), as is remarkably illustrated in the Book of Asmaght.

The style of the

letter is peculias to the Irish school, and the famin likcness can be traced in manu-

scripts which are now found in situations very remoted from one another.

It is very

probable that a chronicle of events, especially obits‘, was kept in the monastery (66),

the ninth century, speeifies the Libri Scoffice scripti.

ler, Bilder und Schnflziiqe in den in'schen Manu-
scripten (Mittheilungen der Antiquarishen Gemell-
sehaft in Zurich, Siebt. Bana. p. 61); also the un-
published Appendix Α. to the Report of the English
Record Commissioners (a most interesting volume,
of which there is a copy in the British Museum, 31111
another 111 Τ110. Coll. Library, DnbL), pp. 79-96.

³ Greek hand-See Plate 3. There is 3 beauti-
ful interlinear Greek 31111 Latin Psalter of the Irish
school preserved in the town library of Bile (A.
vii. 3), mentioued by Wetstein (N. Test. Gr. vol. ii.
p. 9), by Dr. Todd (Book of Hymns, fascic. 1,
p. 55), 3011 by Dr. Keller, who 1135 printed a speci-

l* Greek lettera—See p. 187, supra. The Life
of St. Brendan furnishes us with the following cu-
11005 11105113ῐί00 of the practice: “Habebat sanctus
Gylldas missalem librum, scriptum Grecis literis.
Et possitus est ille liber super altare. Et custos
templi cx jussione sancti Gillde dixit 5311οῑ0 Bren-
dano‚ Vir Dei, precepit tibi sanctus senex noster ut
offeres corpus Christi, Ecce altare, hunc librum
Grecis literis scriptum, et canta in eo sicut abbas
noster. Accipiensque sanctus Brendanus librum
ait, Demonstra michi Domine ι111050, istas literas
ignorans, sicut aperuisti ostia clausa aute nos.
Profecto possibilia omnia sunt credenti. Ilico jam
literas Grecas scivit sanctus Brendanus sicuti Lati-
nas quas didicit ab infantia. Et coepit missam can-
tare.”—Cod. Marsh. fol. 63 ab. On the practice of
writing Latin in Greek characters, see Dr. Graves

ἃ Remote.-.Cod. A.. formerly preserved at Rei-
chenau, is at present in the Town Library of Schaff-
hausen. 'nie Cod. Sangallensis of the Gospels was
written by 311 Irish scribe; and the Book of Armagh
1135 never left Ireland. The Cod. Boerneriauus, a
MS. of St. Paul's Epissses, corresponding to the
Cod. Sangallensis, after passing through various
hands between Paulus J unius and Professor Boemer,
is «now in the Royal Library of Dresden. At foot
of fol. 23 are six 111105, which have been 3 mystery
to all the biblical critics of the Continent, and which
the late Dr. Ingrata of Oxrord, 1111115 ardoni· for the
honour os Sason literature, endeavoured to inter-
pret. Had he succeeded in the attempt, the name
Anylo-Sazon, so common 3 term for every literary
monument of the British Isles, would not have been
a misnomer for the writing of this manuscript, or
any of its school ; but Saxon helped him as little in
the endeavour as Irish did 3 late speculator on the
Eugubiau Tables; aud in this case it was left for
the Irish to assert their legitimate claim to their
national monument, and, in reading these lines with
ease and certainty, to identify their name with many
of the most beautiful and venerable manuscripts to
be found in Europe. Keller and Zeuss have settled
the question for ever. See Irish Eccles. Journal,
vol. V. p. 138.

Ε ohim—The custom of keeping such ent-ries is

‘⁶ egressus requisivit in annali s‘uo, et invenit eadem
ipsa die Osualdum regem fnisse peremptnm.⁷'—-

bably kept in all the Irish monasteries.
