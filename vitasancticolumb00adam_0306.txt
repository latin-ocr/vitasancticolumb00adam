ξ’ Sumtus—This may be taken metaphori-
cally, for, on the expulsion of the demons to
1118 Ethica terra, their assaults were felt 111 the
form of pestilent diseases. Thus the word
(111οω 15 used in Psal. xci. 5 ς and ῐος in Iliad,
A. 48. At sea their violence was experienced
in the raging of tempests. See ii. 34 (p. 149)
supra, cap. iii. 13 (p. 214) infra.

· Pauli armatura.—Ephes. vi. 13-17. It was
thus, as Bede relateS, that St. Cuthbert freed
the little island of Farne from demoniacal oc-
cupation. Vit. S.Cuthb. c. 173 Hist. Eccl. iv. 28.

¹¹ Ethiczzm terram—The island of Tiree. See
1101811, i. 19 (p. 48) supra. To which may bo
added, in reference to the transition forms of
the name, that Martin calls it Tire—2¹31, but
partly errs in deriving it from Tire, 3 country,
and ty, an isthmus. (West. Islands, p. 267.)

Croagh Patrick, a mountain in Mayo, is fa-

Patrick's final conflict with the demens of Ire-

ocean, and completed their diseomfiture by
flinging his bell, the Bearnan Briyhde, among
their retreaiing ranks. (vit. Trip. ii. 64, Tr.
Th. p. 138 a.) Passing northwards, they
emerged from the deep, and took up their
abode in the savage wilds of Seangleann, on
the south-west of Donegal. Here they re-
mained unmolested till our Tirconnellian saint
was directed by an angel 10 rid the place of
its soul inhabitants. After a violent struggle
with the demens, he completely routed them,
and with the help of the Dubh-duaibseacla his
bell, drove them once for all into the sea. His
name was henceforward associated with the
tract, and the wild par-ish of Gleneolumbkill
preserves in its topography and traditions a
living commentary on the legend of St. Co—
lumba‘s first visit to it, as told by Manus O’Don-
nell in 1510. (vit. S. Columbae, i. 89, Tr. Th.
p. 403 b.) Sliabh Liag, commonly called Slieve-
League, a precipitous mountain in this region,
commands, in clear weather, a view of Croagh
Patrick on the south-west.
