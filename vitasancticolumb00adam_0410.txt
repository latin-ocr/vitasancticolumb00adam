Martyrology, as well as those of Bedee and N otker, we have domestic and foreign testi-
monies agreeing with the (late which has been observed for the solemnity within the
memor5 of man. We learn, however, from Adamnan the following particulam, which,
taken in conjunction with the date of the festival, determine the year with great pre-
(¹1810n :—

1. Saturday was the last day of the saint‘s lifed.
. He had attended the nocturnal vigils⁹.
shortly after midnight he rose for matins&
Which was the second service of Sunday.
And just as the brethren had assembledg.
While it was still dark in the oratory, for his attendant was obh'ged to feel after
him, and was unable to discern his condition till lanterns were brought.

7. That this portion of the twenty-four hours was called the 721ka qs Sanday‘n

8. That, therefore, he died on Sunday.

9. That the ninth of June fell on Sunday.

Now the Regular letter of the ninth of June is f ς therefore F was the Sunday letter
of the year. But 597 is the only year at this period to which F belongs, that is, whose
first of J anuznwv fell on Tuesday. Thus, as far as Adamnan's statements go, the infer—
ence is very explicit, and we are freed from the uneertainty which Ussher expresses z

‘⁴ Cum media noete Romani civiles suos dies et incipere soleant et terminare: num nox
illa media, qua Columbam decessisse diximus, diem Junii nonum vel inchoaverit vel
finierit, quaestiom's quid habet‘’³. With regard to Adamnan's language, there cannot
he any uneertainty; for he represents the saint as saying, while it was yet Saturday,
‘¹ hac sequenti media venerabili Dominica nocte patmm gradiar viam‚'' and states of
the penultimate service which he attended, “ Sanetus ad vespertinalem Dominicae noctis
missam ingreditur ecclesiam.'⁷ Adamnan reckons his day from sunset to sunset, and
thus we find him, on more than one occasion, employing a νυχθήμερον, and making the
night of a festival precede the dayj. See ii. 45 (p. 181), 111. 1 1 (p. 210), 12 (p. 211),
23 (230, 2 33). With this date agree the biographer's chronological notes, who states
that St. Columba passed over to Britain in the second year after the battle of Culdreibhne,
that is, in 56 3, being then 42 years oldk, and that he died, having completed 34 years
111 his pilgrimage¹, thus giving 597 for his obit, and 76 years for his age. So also Bede,
