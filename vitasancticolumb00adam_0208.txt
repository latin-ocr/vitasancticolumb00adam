Sodhan, was son of Fiaeha Araidhe, founder of
the Dal-Araidhe. See O'Flaherty, Ogyg. p.

d mihim—This is now corrupted to Delvin,
but has no connexion with the true Delvin,
which is Oesstbno, a territorial name. The
Delvin river rises in the county of Meath, and,
flowing through a roeky valley called the Glen
of Roches, passes under Knocknagin Bridge,
and falls into the sea at Gormanstown‚ a little
north of Balbriggan. It is an inconsiderable
stream, and is only remarkable on account of
its old associations, and as being the boundary
between the enunties of Dublin (Ord. Surv. 5. 1)
and Meath (ih. s. 28). The present allusion to
it and Dubliu is a very carious topographical
notice, for it proves that the territory of Fin-
gall was defined at that early date by the same
limits as in modern times. The name Ailbene
occurs only once in the Four Masters, but in
that instance in exaetly the samerelation that
it does here. A. D. 1052, Cpeoch ῑα mue

“As for the name os your noble pleasant plain,
'Tis an ancient name vnthout doubt or questiom
So called erom the high-faced stout pillar,
From Mun-edhach son os cormac:

This occurs at the close of a poem of twenty-
four stanzas, on the origin of Inbher Ailln‘ne.
Its legend is thus told in the prose recital:
‘⁴ Inbher Ailbine, whence it was named. That
is not difficult. Ruadh mac Righduinn, son of
the king of Fir-Muiridh, collected a crew of
four canoes to eross the 583. 111 order to visit
his foster-brother the son of the king of Loch-
lann. When they reached the middle of the sea,
they failed to move in any directim, but stood
as is held by an anehor. Ruadh then went out
over the ship to ascertain the cause of the de-
tention, and went under the tide, and saw nine
women the sairest ofthe race, holding, three to
each canoe. They took Ruadh with them, and
he lay niue nights with them in their land; and
one of them became pregnant by him. And he
promised to visit them on his return‚if he could.
Ruadh then went to the house of his foster-
brother, and remained with him seven years.
