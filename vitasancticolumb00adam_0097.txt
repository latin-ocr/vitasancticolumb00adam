of Movillek, also one of our saint's preceptorS, was removed by death in 5⁶79. About
the same time a question arose between St. Columba and St. Comgau, concerning a
chureh in the neighbourhood of Colereine, which was taken up by their respective
races, and engaged them in sanguinary sti-ifel. In 587 another battle was fought,
namely, at Cuffledham, near Clonard, in which engagement also St. Columba 13 said
to have been an interested party.

In judging of the martial propensities of St. Columba, it will always be necessary
to bear in mind the complexion of the times in which he was born, and the peculiar-
condition of society 111 1113 day, which required even women to enter battle, and justi<
fied ecelesiastics in the occasional exercise of warfarefl. Moreover, if we may judgc
from ‘che biographical records which have descended to 113, primitive Irish ecclesi-
astics, and especially the superior class, commonly known as Saints, were very impa-
tient of contradiction, and very rescntful of injui·y⁰. Excommunieation, fasting
against, and cursing, were in fiequent employment, and inanimam, as well as animate
objects are represented as the subjects of their maledictionS. St. Columba, who seems
to have inherited the high bearing of his racc, was not disposed to receive injuries, or
even affronts, in silence. Adamnan relatesp how he pursued a plunderer with curseS,
following the retin'ng boat into the sea, until the water reached to his knees. W c
have an accountq also of 1113 cursing a miser who neglected to extend hospitality to
him. On another occasion', in Himba, 110 excommunicated some plunderers of the
church; and one of thom afterwards pcrished in eombat, being transfixed by a spear
which was discharged in St. Columba’s name. Possibly some current stdries ot‘thc
Saint’s imperious and vindictive tempers may have suggested to Venerablc Bede‘ the
qualified approbation “qualiscumque suerit ipse, 1103 1100 de illo certum tenemus, quia

reliquit successores magna continentia ae divino amore regularique institutione insig-
