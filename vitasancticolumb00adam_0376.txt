ΙΝ Praef. z, St. Columba is styled ‘⁴ monasteriorum pater et fimdat0r‚” in reference to
the numerous ohurches which were founded, either by his discipleS, or by himself
(lireetly. Again, in ii. 46 (p. 184), mention is made of his “ monasteria intra utrorum-
que populorum [sc. Pictorum et Scotorum Britanniae] terminos fundata.'’ In the old
In'sh Life the number of his churehes is stated as very great, Cpl 060 oo Ῐιοῐιωηῡ
