full demand. Adamnan’s demand waS, that a complete restoration of the captives
should be made to him, and that no Saxon should ever again go upon a predatory ex-
cursion to Erin; and Adamnan brought back all the captives.’' The secret of his
success is told by Adamnan himself¹, “ regem Aldfiidum visitantes amicum;'' and the
result is briefly but satisfactorily stated by the Annals at 687, which is 686 according
to Bede : “ Adamnan conducted sixty captives to Ireland.'’ It may have been about
this period that the Synod was held in Ireland to which Adamnan alludes at p. 178 ;
his language at the end of the chapter (p. 182) seems to regard it as an occurrence of
some standing when he wrote. It is to be regretted that he gives no clue to the year,
object, or place of meeting. At the time of his first visit to Aldfi'id, a great mortality
prerailed in Europe, from which, however, the Scots and Piets of North Britain were
providentially exemptedm; and two years afterwards, when he undertook a second
journey to the Northumbrian court, disease was still ravaging the country, although not
permitted to touch him or one of his attendants. The object of this visit is not stated
by Adamnan, but it probably was some matter of international policy which Adamnan
was chosen to negotiate. The fact that he sailed direct to Ireland with the liberated
captives in 686, seems to justify the reference of the following statement in Bede¹² to
a later date, when he returned to Hy, and subsequently crossed over to Ireland :
“Quo tempore plurima pars Scottorum in Hibernia, et nonnulla etiam de Brittonibus
in Brittania⁰ rationabile et ecclesiasticum paschalis observantiae tempus Domino do-
nante suscepit. Siquidem Adamnan presbyter et abbas monachorum qui erant in
insula Hfi, cum leqationis qratia missus a sua yeme, venisset ad Aldfiu'dum regem An-
glorum, et aliquandiu in ea provincia moratus, videret ritus ecclesiae canonicos; sed et
a pluribus qui erant eruditiores esset sollerter admonitus, ne contra universalem eccle—
siae morem, vel in observantia paschali, vel in aliis quibusque decretis cum suis paucis—
simis ct in extremo mundi angulo positis vivere praesumeret, mutatus mente est; ita
ut ca quae viderat et audierat in ecclesiis Anglorum, suae suorumque consuetudini
libentissime praeferret. Erat enim vir bonus et sapiem‚ et scientia Scripturarum nobi-
lissime ins-tructus. Qui cum domum rediisset, curavit suos qui erant in flii, quive
eidem erant subditi monasten'o, ad eum quem cognoverat, quemque ipse toto ex corde
susceperat, veritatis callem perducere, nec valujtl’ He then goes on to tell of Adam-
nan’s voyage to Ireland; but of that presently. In reference to this visit he gives the
following interesting account of Adamnan’s tract on the Holy Places ε “ Scripsit idem
vir de Locis Sanctis librum legentibus multis utillimum cujus auctor erat docendo ac
dictando Galliarum episcopus Arcuulfus, qm· locorum gratia sanctorum venerat Hiero-
