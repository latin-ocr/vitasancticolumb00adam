gards the battle of Cal-(lstimhne, fi‘om the mention of it by Mannum, who in two

instanees makes it a kind of Hegira in the Saint’s life.

The following narrative from

Keating's History affords the simplest statement of the prevalent belief :—

Now this is the cause why Molaise
scnteneed Columcille to go into Alba, be-
cause it came of him to occasion three
battles in Erin, viz.y the battle of Cul
Dreimhne, the battle of Rathan, and the
battle of Cujl Feadha. The cause of the
battle of Cu] Feadha, according to the old
book called the Leabar Uidhre of (haran,
Diarmm‘d, son ofFergus Cerrbhoil, kingrot'
Ireland, made the F east of Tara, and a
noble man was killed at that feast by
Curnan⁷ son of Aodh, son of Eoehujdh

Tiorm-oamae wherefore Diarmuid kffled ι

him in rex-enge for that, because he eom-
mitted murder at the feast of Tara, against
law and the sanetuary of the feast; and
before Cmnan was put to death he fied to
the protect-lon of Columcille, and notwith-
standing the protection of columcille he
was killed by Diarmuid. And from that it
arose that Columcille mustered the Clanna
N eill of the North, because 1115 own pro-
tection and the protect-lon of the sons of
Eare was w'olated: whereupon the battle
of Cuile Dreimhne was gained over Diar-
maid and over the Connaghtmen, so that
they were defeated through the prayer of
Columeille.

The Black Book of Molaga assigns ano-
ther cause why the battle of Cu] Dreimhne
was fought, viz„ 111 consequence of the
false judgment which Diamuid gave
against Columeille when he wrote the gos-
pel out of the book of Finm'an without his
knowledge. Finnian said that it was to
