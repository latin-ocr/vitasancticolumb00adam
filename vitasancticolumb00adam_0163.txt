Latin language, because in such case the
teacher could be his own interpreter. Ven.
Bede, also, recognises the distinction, for he
states the five written languages of Great. Bri-
tain to be “ Anglorum, Brittonum, Scottorum,
Pictorum, et Latinorum” (H. E. i. 1); and the
four spoken tongues to be ‘⁸ Brittonum, Picto—
rum, Scottorum, et Anglorum” (Ibid. iii. 6).
The Pictish was undoubtedly a Celtic dialect,
but more nearly allied to the British οι· Welsh
than the Gaelic. Of this the eastern topogra—
phy of scotland is satisfactory evidence: to
which may be added the foui· recorded Pictish
words Cartoit (J. *oeotfi ,1. beonia Cnuicueae.

Skabost-bridge, on an island of the river Sui-
