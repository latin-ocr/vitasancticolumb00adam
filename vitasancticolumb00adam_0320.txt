¹³ Comyellus Mocu Aridi.-In the Antipho-
nary of Bangor (circ. 690) his name is written
Comqillus; in his Life, Comyallus. In the early
Calendars and Annals it is always written
Comfiull.. The meaning assigned by some is
pulchrum piynus (Flem. Collect. pp. 302 b,
304 b, marg-3 Act. SS. Mai. tom. ii. p. 580),
but there is the highest authority sor a differ-
ent interpretation. St. Columbanus, his dis-
ciple⁷ in his Instructio ii. thus writes: “Non
primum nostrae parvitatis fundamenta jacere
praesumimus, alicujus majoris doctoris autho-
ritatem quaerenteS, sancti scilicet Fausti lucu-
lentissimam, elegantissimamque doctrinam, de
cujus dictis pauca ad initiandum opus nostrum
satis convenienter elegimus.’' (Flem. Collect.
p. 47 a.) So also Notker Balbulus: “Cum plur-
imos discipulos, vel socios sanctitatis suae pares
habuisset. unum tamen Congellum. latineFausti
nomine illustrem, praeceptorem B. Columbani,
magistri domini et patris nostri Galli.'¹-Mar-
tyrol. Jun. 9. Comgall was born in Mourne,
now Magheramorne, a district on the coast of
the county of Antrim, a little south of Larne,
ffleeves, Eccl. Ant. p. 269.) His father's name
was Setna, and his mother‘s Brig, and they be-
longed to the kingdom of Dal-Araidhe, or Dal-
nary as the Life calls it. which comprehendedthe
southern half os the county of Antrim. (Flem.
Collect. p. 303 a.) The tribe name given to
Comgall in the text is inno u (lumbe, filius
nepotum Araidz'. he being fourteenth in descent
from Fiacha Araidhe (circ. 220), the ancestor
of the Dal-Araidhe, whose territory was com-
monly called Dalaradia. See Reeves, Eecl.
Antiqq. pp. 334-342. Comgall, according to
Tighernach, was born in 517 (An. Ult. 516);

May 10, at which day two Lives are printed in
the Bollandists. They are also given by Fle-
ming (Collect. pp. 303-313). The Antiphonary
of Bangor, published by Muratori from an an-
cient Bobio manuscript (Aneedota Ambros. vol.
iv. p. pp. 127—159; reprinted in his Opere, tom.
xi. pmii. pp. 217-251), preserves a very curious
alphabetical hymn on St. Comgall. See i. 49
(p. 92), cap. ¹3 (p. 213), supra.

⁶ Cainneclzus Mocu Delam—See i. 4 (p. 28),
ii. 13 (p. 121), 14 (p. 123), supra. He was akin
to St. Comghall, being a descendant of Rudh-
raighe Mor, of the race of Ir, king of Ireland.
but of a totally different stoek from St. Co-
lumba. The family he belonged to was the
corea-Danum, a branch of the Clanna Rudh-
raighe (Ogyg. p. 275 ς Ir. Nennius, p. 264), and
from Dalan. his great-grandfather, he derived
the surname moc·uu-Oolnnn‚ filius nepotis
Dallam', mentioned in the text, and other
authorities. (An. Inisfall. 595 ; Bat. of Magh
Rath, p. 26.) ln the Feilire of AEngus, at his
day, Oct. 11, he is commemorated as CGlN-
