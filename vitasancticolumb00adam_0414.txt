31 4 Additional Notas. [³1-

The words pro undecima are difficult of explanation, but they were so at- the time the
manuscript was written, for the scribo has placed in the margin opposite pro the mark
of obscurity. ,But whatever ambiguity may attend some words, it is plain that con-
ductio is employed to denote ‘ bringing togethe1·‚' or ‘transfer‘k3 as elsewhere, in the
same manuscript, ‘ mecting,' ¹ interw'ew’l ; and that the passage expresses the belief
as existing, at the close of the eighth century, that the bones of Columkfflem had, be-
fore that period, been brought to Ireland from Britain„ and deposited in Saul.

The same impression is conveyed in another but more legondmy record, and seem-
ingly of a later date, which also supposes St. Columba’s rcmains to have been conveyed
into the innermost part of Strangford Lough, in the county of Down, and merely dif-
fers in making Downpatrick the destinat-ion instead of the neighbouring church of
Saul. O’Donnell’s account of the matter is thus translated by Colgan: “Pro operis
hujus coronide (quod minime debuit silentio pertransiri) hic subjicio quomodo corpus
hujus S. Patriarchae in Monasterio Hiensi prius sepultum, fuerit in Hiberniam postea
translatum, et in eodem sepulchro cum sacris exuviis Sanctorum Patricii et Brigidae

at p. 242, supra. His death is entered in the An.
Ult. at 845: Ferdonmach, sapiens, et scriba opti«
mus Ardmachae dormivit. How just this character
was, the execution of the Book os Asmagh, now
open before the writer, fully proves.

*- Transfer-.— The late ingenious archaeologist,
the Hon. Algemon Herbert, in a paper ⁴⁴ On the
Peculiarities of Culdeism” (British Magazine, vol.
xxvi. p. 249), has the following observation on this
passage: ‘⁶ It would seem, that Iona was to be the
seat of the last judgment; for we read 'm Tirechan
that, eleven miles from the grave of St. Patr-ick, was
¹ the embarkation [conductio] of the mai-tyrs, or port
[ostium] os Columcille from Britain, and the em—
barkation of all the saints from Ireland at the day
of judgment.' From Ireland to Iona, since Iona
alone was to be unsubmergeds· A comparison of
this passage with the genuine extract in the text
will show how easily an oriyinal authority may be
brought to bear any way one wishes, and will natu-

rally create distrust 111 a paradox founded on such
evidence. Saul is not two miles from Downpatriek.

¹¹¹ Bones of Columcille.—That the word ossuum
has been correctly assigned as a gloss to martirum
in the restoration proposed in the text, will be seen
from the following enti-ies in the early Annals :—
734, Commutacio martirum Petair et Poil et Pa-
draic ad leyem perficiendam (Tigh., An. Ult.) 743,
Commutatio martirum Treno Cille Delyz'n (Hasd).
775, Commutatio martirum sancti Erce Slane; et
comntatio martirum Finniani Cluana-Iraird. (An.
Ult.) After A. D. 77 5, the Annals of Ulster employ
the term reliquiarum instead (784, 789, 792, 793,
799, 800). Cathal Maguir, who compiled these
Annals, bon-owed from a succession of original
chrouicles, and the change in the terms probably
indicates a change of author. mupcpc( isthe ana·

signifying ‘Church of the relies,’ derives its name
from the same word.
