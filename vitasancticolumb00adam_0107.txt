Aug. ¹9· and is to be distinguished from St.
Mochta de Insula, son of Cernaehan, who died
in 922 at his ehurch of luis-Mochta, now Inish-
mot, in the county of Meath. The former, in his
life, is described as “ortus ex Britannia,” and
as landing at Omeath‚ in the county of Louth,
with twelve followers. Hence his title “pros-
elytus'' Tighernach and the Annals of Ulster
record his death at 534: ‘⁴ Dormitatio Moctai
discipuli Patricii, xvi. Kal. Sept. Sic ipse
scripsit in epistola sua Moeteus [Macutenus
-Ανιιι, υἷι] peccator prespiter, sancti Patricii
discipulus, in Domino salutem.'' By O'Donnell he
is styled “ Hiberniensium sacerdotum primice-
rius'' (Colg.Tr.Th. 389 b); andin the Tripartite
Life of St. Patrick ⁴⁴ Patricii Archipraesbyter,''
(iii. 98. Tr. Th. p. 167). He may be the Manc-
teus or Mochod who is named in the Annals of
Ulster at 471, 51 1, 527. The Calendars style
him bislwp, but the authorities here cited limit
his rank to the priesthood. See Colg. Aet. SS.

' Disterminabuneur.—We have no record of
any church or lands of St. Columba being situ-
ate near St. Mochta’s church of Louth, nor of
any other church under this saint's patronage,
except Louth, and Kilmore in the barony and

county os Monaghan. The ancient chapel ot'
Ardpatrick, which lay about half a mile south-
east, and Cnoc-na-seangain, where the abbey
of Knock was founded, in 1148, are both in the
parish of Louth⁷ and one of them may origi-
nally have been appropriated as in the text.
O'Donnell refers this prophocy to Iona, and
represents St. Mochta as sojourning there be-
fore the settlement os Columba.-i. 3 (Tr. Th.
p. 389 b.) But this is opposed to the statement
in St. Mochta’s Life: ¹⁸ Alio tempore offerente
ei rege, scilicet filio Colcan Aedo. agrum acci-
pere renuit. dieens; Nascetur in aquilonali Hi-
berniae plaga sanetus nomine Columba, electus
Deo et dilectus, cui a Deo ager iste datus: eui
non tantum Hibernia sed et Britannia serviet ;“’
cap. 16 (Act. SS. p. 730 b); where—(notwith-
standing a great. anachronism, for St. Mochta
died in 534; whereas Aodh son of Colga. the
alleged donor, lived till 606)—we have evidence
that Ireland was referred to, and that part ot*
it in which Louth is situate, for this prince was
lord of Oriel and Orior. Four Mast. A.C. 606;

is found in all manuscripts and printed edi-
tions, proves the genuineness of the first chap-
ter. See the first note on it; infra p. 11.
