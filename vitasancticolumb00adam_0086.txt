lxvi Ajfflendioe to Preface.

Stat. Accountm says z “ The name of this parish was formerly ’Τ Eunan, or St. Eunan,
after the saint of that name to whom the ehurch had been dedicated.'' In the N ew
Stat. Aecount¹¹‚ it is added that the ruins of the chapel still remain, at ‘tho mouth of
a rivulet which falls into the Deveron. The valuable writer in the Collections on the
Shires of Aberdeen and Banff⁰‚ observes: “ Mr. Thomas Innes takes him to be the
very same with Saint Adamnan, who in Irish is called Ainan, and ‘their day is the
same, September the twenty-thir& Teunan being formed from Saint Ainan, as Trowel
and Tanta-n from Saint Rule and Saint Antony.'' In this parish was formerly kept
St. Columba's sacred banner, called the Breacbannaeh, mentioned at p. 330, infra; and
he was also a patron of tho church.

3. Αὒοψι.-Α parish in the south of Aberdeenshirc, on the north side os the Dee.
“Aboyn hath for its tutelar Saint Theunan'⁷¹·. About halfwny between Aboyne
Castle and the ruins of the ancient parish chureh, is a large old tree, now called the
Skeulan Treeq, with a well at the foot of it called the Skeulan Well. The troe is still
held 111 reverence. Thomas [mies‘ tells us that he was born in this parish, aud
mentions tho objects alluded to as called in his day ‘ S. Eunan's XVell,y and ‘ S. Eu-
nan⁷s Tree.’

4. Tamzadz'ce.—A parish 111 Forsar, whose patron was St. Columba. A large rock
on one of the braes of Augus, 111 this parish, is called St. Arnolcl's Seaff. That this
name, though apparently so far removed, has been formed from Adamana, appears by
the following extract from a. record of 1 527²: “Et 510 eundo versus austrum usquo ad
eaput montis vocate Samot Eunendi’s Seitss’ Who could suppose that the names St. Ar-
nold's seat and Syomm were identieal in meaning!

5. hemeah—An island in the Frith of Forth, E. N. E. os Ineh Colm. ‘¹ 1110110-

Servanmn, cum sociis 511151 111 ipsa insula, ad primum suum adventum in Scotiam.”
So Fordunu states, more trustworthy 111 1115 nomenclature than his chronology.

6. Samia—An island off the Mun of Cantyre, on the S. E. Fordun says of itv:
“ Insula Awyn, ubi cella Sancti Adanmam‘, ibique pro transgressoribus refugium.’'
Father Mae Oana’s MS. accountw of the island states that in Irish it is called Clbhumn,
