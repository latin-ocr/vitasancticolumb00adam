peculiar heavy hand which is found in the oldest Irish manuscripts, not indeed
as round as that of the Books of Kells or Dum-ow, but possessing many sea-
tures in common, and claiming priority to the Book of Armagh, the date of
which is fixed to the year 807. 2. The Greek character which appears in the
text, as shown in the following facsimile of the colophon of the second book-

sslm‘rqv estpuuduc-L18ep..s

and more at length in the Lord's Prayer, which is written on the last page of
the manuscript, in sclni-uncials, without accents or breathings. 3. The parch-
ment, which is made of young goat-skin‚ and evidenccs by its colour and con—
dition extreme age. 4. The remarkable colophon of the scribe, which, taken
in connexion with other evidence, is of the greatest weight. It is in rubric on
page 136 α, and records the name Dorbbeneus (242), one of extreme rarity‚in
Irish records, and of which the present writer knows no examples but the two
which are mentioned in the Annals‚ in connexion with Hy. One of these is the
entry at A. D. 724, which records the death ofFaelcu‚ son of Dorbene( 3 8 1, 38 2),
and the other that which records the death of Dorbene, who was elected to the
chair of St. Columba at Hy in A.D. 713, and died the same year (381). The
former Dorbene was probably a layman, and anterior to Adamnan3 the latter
was probably only half a generation junior to Adamnan‚ whom he survived
but nine years. To ascribe the manuscript to this individual is to claim a very
early date for it, and it may be objected that it was written by another person
of this name, or copied by a later hand from the autograph of this Dorbene.
The former exception is not probable, the name being almost unique, and
found so pointedly connected with the Columbian socicty3 the latter is less
pmbable, as the colophon in Irish manuscripts is always peculial· to the actual
scribe, and likely to be omitted in transcription, as is the case of the later mae
nuscripts of the same recension preserved in the British Museum. 5. The
judgments of those who have examined it. Colgan‚ on XVhste’S repom 5ηγεω,
“ Exemplar illud Codicis Augiensis tam vetustum et tanta fide et integritate
exaratum est, ut nisi Codex ipse esset in Germania repertus, non aliud vide-
retur ab eo, quod S. Dorbeneus Abbas Hiensis, S. Adamnani discipulus, ipso
Adamnano adhuc vivente, vel paulo post ejus mortem, sua manu scripsit.”
