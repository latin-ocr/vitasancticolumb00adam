Ε Dorsum Britannioe.——See i. 34 (p. 64), cap.

‘¹ Brudeo rega-See cap. 33 (p. 146 )‚ and 35
(p. 150), supra. It appears from the latter that,
aster his conversion, Brudeus continued till the
end ofhis lise to hold St. Columba in the highest
esteem.

² Ort-adum—This is the name of the Orkney
Islands in Mela and Pliny. The Irish called
them lnnpu hOpc, and the adjacent sea the
mum nOpc, which they regarded as the ex-
treme northern boundary of Britain, the nium
nlchc, or British Channel, being the southern
(Ir. Nennius, p. 30). They were inhabited in
the first century, for Agricola “incognitas ad
id tempus insulas, quas Orcadas vocant, inve-
nit domuitque. Dispecta est Thule quadam te-
nus,’' διο. (Tacit. Agric. 10.) We may suppose
that the first wave os Celtic populatiou in
Britain extended northwards to them (Ir.
Nen.p. 30). Tradition says the Fir—Galeoin (a
tribe ofthe Firbolgs), and the Picts‚ were suc-
cessively occupants of them: and that thence
a portion of the latter passed over tothe Franks
(lb. pp. 48, 50, 52). The Latin Nennins also
states that the Picts‚ at an early period, occu-
pied the Orcades, c. 12 (p. 9, ed. Stev.); but
elsewhere he speaks ofthe island, “in extremo
limite orbis Brittanniae ultra Pictos, et vocatur
Orc.”—c. 8 (p. 7, ih.) When Hengist offered
the services of Octha and Ebissa, “ut dimi-
cent contra Scottos,” they were invited to
Britain, and “ eum navigarent contra Pictos¹
vastaverunt Orcades iusulas.'' (Nennius, c.
38, p. 29, ib.) From which it would appear
that in the fifth century these islands were
possessed by the Picts‚ whose occupation pro-
bably continued till at least the close of the

sixth century. Chalmers supposes that at the
date referred to in the text the inhabitants
were Scandinavians (Caledon. i. p. 262). See
the judicious remarks in Irish Nennius, p. 146;
and the authorities cited iu the following note.

cuil, p. ¹33 (Par. 1814).

f Cujus obsides—The Dalriadic Scots at this
period extended their enterprise as far as these
islands. The An. Ult., at 579, record peche
Ope 10 hCleDon nnc monum, ⁴ an expedition
against the Orkneys by Aedan. son of Gabh-
ran'; and again at 580. It may be that at
this time a northern colony had established
itself in the Orkneys, if we may judge from
GodboItL the name oftheir king, who, according
to Brompton, fell at the battle of Haethselth in
633. (Twysden, Hist. Angl. Seript. Dec., p. 784;
also Galfrid. Monemut. xii. 8.) ln 682, Bruidhe
mac Bile, king of the Picts‚ the successful op-
ponent of the Saxons, reduced these islands:
Orcades deletae sunt ῑο [per] Bruidlte.—Tigh.
(So An. Ult. 681.) They were again invaded
in 709: Bellum pop Opcfflbh [contra Orcadas]
in quo filius Artablair jacuit.-An. Ult. 708.
T. 1nnes, in reference to the present passage,
observes: “ By this it appears that the prince
of the Orkneys was subject and tributary to
the king of the Picts‚ and that the Pictish do-
minions extended to the utmost bounds of the
north of Britain and adjacent islands.'' (Civ.
Eccl. Hist. p. 206.) Chalmers, on the other
hand, declares “it is sufficiently apparent that
neither the Picts‚ nor Scots, had any pretence
of right over the Orkney, and Shetland isles.
The contemporary inhabitants of both were of
a different lineage, as we have seen; and owed
their obedience to their original country. The
