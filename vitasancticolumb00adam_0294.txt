qui illius seniores ⁹coetus seorsim ¹⁰ceteris redarguerent ¹¹semotis, dicentes,
¹²Quare coram excommunicato surgere ¹³et eum exosculari ¹⁴non renueris?
taliter ad eos inquiens, Si vos, ait, videritis ea quae mihi Dominus hac in die
de hoc suo, quem dehonoratis, electo manifestare ¹⁵non ›ededignatus est, nun-
quam excommunicassetis ¹⁷quem 18Deus non solum, secundum vestram non
rectam sententiam, nullo excommunicat modo, sed ¹⁹etiam magis 2⁰ac magis
”magnificat Illi e contra, Quomodo, aiunt, ut dieiS,'ipsum glorificat Deus,
quem nos non sine ²²causa excommunicavimus, seire cupimus P Ignicomam
et valde luminosam, ait Brendenus, columnam vidi eundem quem vos despi-
citis antecedentem Dei hominem. Angelos quoque sanctos per campum ejus
itineris comites. Hunc itaque spernere non audeo quem populorum ducem ad
vitam a Deo praeordinatum video. His ab eo dictis, ²‘'non tantum, ultra Sanc-
tum excommunicare non ausi, cessarunt, sed etiam valde venerati honorarunt.

⁴¹ Hi Temen—There being no Latin preposi-
tion in the clause, it is plain that the particle
hi, which is the Irish for in, must be understood
as supplying its place. Thus in the sequel
to this Life, preserved in the Cod. B., we find
“ qui sepultus est hi Cuiluisci” (fol.70 a).‘1n like
manner, in the Latin memoirs in the Book of
Armagh, Izi Raiffl-chunyi, Izi Tamnuch (fol.
1 1 bb), 1ιί Muiriscc (Ιό. fol. 13 b α), hi Rath-
Aryi (lb. fol. a α), fecit alteram hi Tortena
(fol. 15 b α), 816. Teilte is most probably the
name which is written “CGlche in Irish records.
It was a place iu Meath, situate between Kells
and Navan, famous in old times for the great
annual assembly and fair, called nonos> Culll-
cenn, which was held there about Luyhnas‚ or
the first os August, of which we find eleven
notices in the Four Masters between the years
539 and 1 168. Taillte was also a seat of roy-
alty, so that the monarch of Ireland was some-
times styled 1113 ῦοιῑῑῐεηη, ⁴ King of Taillte’
(Book of Rights, p. 143); and as the ancient

Irish synods generally embraced representa-
tives of the seeular as well as ecclesiastical
authorities, and were, for this reason, held in
places of civil note, as Tara, Uisnech, and
Cashel, we can easily perceive the principle
upon which the present synod was held at a
royal station in Meam, especially if the object
was, as White, Ussher, and Colgan suppose, to
censure St. Columba in precipitating the battle
of Cul-Dreimhne, Dermot Mac Cerbhaill being
monarch of Ireland at the time, aud Meath his
hereditary dominion. A remarkable record of
the union of the secular and religious in refer-
ence to this place and saint, occurs in the An.
