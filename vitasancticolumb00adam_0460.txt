ber till the beginning of Lent, the first meal eontinually after norw,- and‚ during Lent
only, the first meal was delayed till the last light of day (cap. 41).

The ordinary Gmments were two 2 the cuculla (136), of coarse texture³‚ made of

wool, {md of the natural colourj of the material3 and the clenica (141), an under—gar-

mentk, which was occasionauy white (175). Instead of the former, when

vestimenta. the woather required, was worn a warnier germont called amphibalw (z ς,

113). The cuculla, sometimes called casulam and ellstan, consisted of the

body and the h00d0, the latter of which was sometimes specially termed the casula.

When working 01· trarelling, they wore calcei Ρ (122, 210), which were fieones (123 n)

Graecos, ap. Ussher, Brit. Eccl. Antiqq. c. 16 (Wks.
vol. vi. p. 278).

1 Coarse textura-The Life of St. Cadoc represents
au angel saying to St. David, ‘⁴ quot e'irri sive jube
in tua eoccula, quod vulgariter vocatur quoddam
genus indumenti, quo Hibernenses utuntur deforis,
plenum prominentibus jube seu villis in modum
ciuium sunt contexte, tot homines per te a penis
perpetuis eruentur.‘'—eap. 14(Rees, Lives Cambro-
Brit. SS. p. 44).

J' Natural colour.-Joce1in, describing St. Pa-
trick’s cowl‚ observes: ¹⁸ Unde et monachi in Hi-
bernia S. Patricii sequendo vestigia, per multa
temporum volumina habitu simplici contenti erant,
quem ovium ministrabat lana⁷ qualibet extrinseca
tinctura remota.'’—Vit. S. Patr. c. 185 (Trias Th.
p. 106 a). The old Irish Life exaggerates the seif-
deniai of Columcille when it asserts, 1111· 5ebet')
1111 nu olunt) prun chnepp, ‘he never put flax or
wool to his skin.y On Sundays and festivals the
brethren went albati (21 1) in snrplices (1³) to
church.

¹* L'nder-yarment.—St. Kiaran's was called pal-
lium. See note m, infra.

¹ ,lmphibalua-See the reference to the Life of

St. Deicola at p. 114, supra. St. Benediet's Rule
says : ‘⁸ Mediocribus locis sufficere credimus Mona-

chis, per singulos, Cucullam et Tunicam: Cucullam
iu hyeme villosam, in {estate puram aut vestutam3
et scapulare propter operas* (cap. 55).

η’ Casula.-The Life of St. Kiaran relates that
one day, meeting a beggar, he gave him his cassula,
and proeeeded in his pallium to luis-Cathay, when

St. Senan meeting him said: “Nonne pudor est
quod sacerdos in uno pallio sine cucullo ambulat.''
—cap. 22 (Cod. Marsh, fol. 146 b a). Saqum also
occurs in cap. 20 (ib.)

τ’ Capa.-St. Comgall's Life relates that ¹¹ Quo-
dam die curn esset S. Comganus solus in agro foris
operans, posuit chrismale suum super vestem suam.
Cum ergo venissent gentiles ad S. Comgallum foris
operantem, et chrismale suum snper cappam suam
vidissent, putaverunt chrismale illud deum S. Corn-
galli esse-''——cap. 22 (Flem. Coli. p. 307 b). The
chrismale, it may be observed, was a box for carry-
ing the consecrated bread of the Eucharist, probably
the inenrcm of the Book of Armagb (fol. 18 a b).
In St. Dega’s Life an anecdote is told similar to that
in p. 141, supra, but instead of tunica the garment
is called capa (Act. Sanct. Aug. tom. iii. p. 6 59 b).

⁰Hood.—St. Kiaran's Life says of his hood,
“ ina casula apud sanctum Senauum qnasi diadema
sanctum.‘'—c. 29 (Cod. Marsh. fol. 147 α b). The
Preface to St. Sechnall's Hymn represents St. Pa-
trick saying, Hocpio (111111 Lo pil. pop currui.

thy cowl, the same number of sinners to go to
heaven, for the Hyan—Leabhar Breac, cited by
Dr. Todd, Book of Hymns (Ir. Arch. Soc.) fase. i.
p. 33. ’See note ¹, supra, for the Welsh version of
the indulgence. The Life of St. Deicola draws a
distinction which seems unique, ‘¹ succinctus cuculla
non cucullo.” (Colg. Aet. SS. p. 1 17 ὁ.)

lumcille's humility, says: mon cpe un impie
