neighbourhood of which some of his writings were preserved 111 Colgan's time ς and afterwards he
founded a church seemingly at Lismore, called the *oeptedo Π] delbora, ‘Oratory of Maeliosa,'
which was burned in 1 1 16. He died on the 16th of J auuary, justly celebrated for his learning
(Colgan, Acta SS. p. 108). His son, Aean, succeeded himin the calling of professor, and died in
109 5. Two years afterwards a. son of Maelbrighde, surnamed Mac-an-tsaeir‚ who was bishop
of Kildare, died. Maelcolaim Ua Brolchaiu, bishop of Armagh, died 111 1 122 ς and Maelbrighde
Ua Brolehain, 3150 bishop of Armagh, died, Jan. 29, 1 139. The latter was probably father of
the coarb Flaitlmertach, whom the Annals of Ulster, at 1 164, call Pldiebepcclch mac 111
0111111111 11111 bn 01011111, ‘Flaithbertach‚ son of the bishop Ua Brolchan,' a lineage by no means
iu accordance with the delicacy of the Four Masters‚ and which, when copying the entry‚ they
divest of its objectionable character, in simply calling him Plaiebepcoch Uo bpotomn.
Domhnall Ua Brolchain was prior of Derry7 and died Apr. 27, 1202. His name is inscribed on
one of the capitals in the cathedral of Hy, in the form Donaldus Obrolcan (vid. 1202, infra).
Finn Ua Brolchan was steward of O⁷D0nne11 in 1213 ς and Flann Ua Brolchain was coarb of
Columcille in 1219. In 1548 died sir John Obmlchan, rector of Kildalton⁷ in Islay (Orig.
Paroch. vol. 11. p. 269). The name was afterwards written O‘Brollaqhan, and 15 now cor-
rupted, in Ulster, to Bradley, Through the influence of Gilia-mac-Liag or Gelasius, the abbot
of Amagh, who had himself been previously abbot of Derry (an. 1137), Flaithbertach Ua
Brolchain was raised to the dignity of bishop in 1158, 35 15 111115 recorded by the Four Masters:
“ A synod of the elergy of Ireland was convened at Bri-mic-Taidhg, in Meam, where there were
present 25 bishops, with the Lege-te of the coarb of Peter, to ordain rules and good morals. It
was on this occasion that the clergy of 1reland, with the coarb of Patrick, ordered a 011311, like
every other bishop's‚ for the coarb of Columcille, Flaithbertach Ua Brolchain, and the arch-
abbacy of the churches of Irelaud in general.” He was a zealous advancer of the welfare of
Derry, and during his incumbency many important additions were made to its ecclesiastical
buildings3 to procure funds for which, the abbot had, during the years 1150, 1151, 1153,
1 161, visited, and obtained contributions from various territories 111 Ulster and Ossory. After
a long life spent in the energetic discharge of his duties, he died in 1175, at which year his
obit is thus recorded by the F our Masters: “ F laithbertach Ua Brolchain, coarb of Columcille¹
a tower of wisdom and hospitality, a man 011 whom, on account of his goodness and wisdom,
the clergy of Ireland had bestowed a bishop's chais, and to whom the abbacy of Hy [00111011-
bur loe] had been offered (311. 1 164), died in righteousness, after exemplary sickness, in the
Duibhregles of Columeille: and Gina-mao-Liag Ua Branain was appointed to his place in the
abbacy.''
