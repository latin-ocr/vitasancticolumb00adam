Thus wc find St. Columba directly or indirectly concerned 111 three battles, the earliest
of which occurred the year but one before his retirement to Britain, and the others at
later periods, one of them aster he had been twenty-four years in the abbaey of Hy.
The first his biographers and panegyrists acknowledge to have been the grand error of
1115 life, for which he paid the penalty of pilgrimage; but to save his character after
he became the apostle of the N orthern Picts, and the religious exemplar ofthe Albanian
Seots, the device is resorted to of antedating the other oecurrences iu which the t‘ailing
of hjs nature betrayed itself; and whereas his participation in these evils could not be
(10111οᾶ, it was thrust back into the irresponsible part of his life, rather than allow it to
be numbered among the acts of his maturity. That Columba, closely allied to the
prineipals 111 these deeds of strife, and within one step himself of the object they were
contending for, should look 011 with indifl‘erence‚ is not to be cxpected‚—especially in
an age of revolution, and among a people whose constitution and national construction
rendered civil faetion almost inseparable from their existence. It was not until 804y
that the monastic eommunitics of Ireland were formally cxemptcd from military ser-
vice; and the endeavours of Fothadh¹ the Canonist, in procuring this enaetmcnt from
Aedh Oirdnidhey the monarch of Ireland, form the subject 01’ panegyric and special
mention in the Amals. That, even among themselves the members of powerful eom-
munities were not insensible to the spirit of faction, appears fi'om numerous entries in
the ancient Annalsy. Of these, two—of which one relates to a Columbian house—may
here be adduced as examples: A. D. 763, “A battle was fought at Argamoyn between
the fraternities of Clonmacnois and Dmow, where Dermod Duff, son of Donnell, was
killed, and Diglac, son of Dubliss, with 200 men of the fratemity of Durrow. Bmsal,
son of Mumhadh, with the fraternity ot' Clonmacnois, was victorl’ A. D. 816, “A
battle was fought by cathal, son of Dunlang, and the fraternity of Tigh-Munna
[Taghmon] against the fraternity of Fems, in which 400 were slain. Maelduin, son of
Cennfaeladh, abbot of Raphoe, of the fraternity of Colum-cille, was slain. The frater-
nity of Colum-cille went 10 Tara to curse [king] Aedh.'⁷ The same principle which
caused St. Columba’s panegyrists to represent his battles as delinqueneies of his youth,
operated with the Four Masters, when compih'ng their comprehensive Aunals from
earlier authorities, in dealing with these oft-reeurring monastic cncounters, and as
there was no opening for a transfer of the blame, they suppresse& the mention of them.
