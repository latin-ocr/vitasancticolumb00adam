The other Lives of St. Columba are the following 2-—

1. That by Cummene, aheady mentioned, and of which an account is
given at p. 199 of this work.

II. The first part of Colgan's Vita Secmzdu‘, which he found in the Sa-
lamanca MS.¹¹, and erroneously supposed to be by Cumineus. It is a succinet
and chronological digest of the principal recorded events of the Saint's life, and
supplies from the old Irish Life some particulare not recorded by Adamnan.

III. A Life by John of Tinmouthx, pirated by Capgravey, and reprinted
by Colgan with notes, in the Trias, where it appears as the Vita Τενίίαῑ. It
is principally compiled from Adamnan, and ends with the monitionss: ‘⁶ Est
autem sciendum quod Hibernia proprie Scotorum est patria: antiquitus igitur
scotia pro Hibernia saepius scribi solet sicut hio in vita sancti Columbe diligenter
intuentibus apparet. Et etiam venerabilis Beda de gestis Anglorum multis
in locis Hiberniam exprimere volem, scotiam scripsit?

IV. The office in the Breviary of Aberdeenb, containing nine short les-
¹sons, borrowed, in an abridged form, from Adamnan.

V. An abridgment of Achmman, printed by Benedict Gononc under the
title Vita S. Columboe, sive Columbanz'‚ Presbyteri et Corfissoris (qui alius est
αὶ S. Columbano Luxoviensz· abbate) esc illa prolixa quam scripsit Adamamzus
abbas Insulae Huensis ἱη Scoticz. It occupies three folio pageS‚ double columns,
and is accompanied by three triffing notulae.

VI. An ancient Irish meumst, frequently referred to in the following
pages as tlze old Irish Life. It is a composition probably as old as the tent-h
century, and was originally compiled, to be read as a discourse on St. Co-
lumba’s festival& on the text Em· de terra tua etde coynotz'one tua, et de domo
