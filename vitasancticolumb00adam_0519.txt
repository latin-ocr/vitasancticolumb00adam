quences of the potato blight have, of late, greatly reduced its amount. The people
are chiefly collected into a little village on the eastern side, and any dwellings which
are detaehed are 111 the arable portions of the northern half, for the southern district is
uninhabited. Previously to the Reformation, the island formed a distinet pai-ish, the
chureh of which, called Tempull-Ronaig, stood within the precincts of the nunnery.
Subsequently it was annexed to the great union of Kilfiniehen and Kilvieeuenh, in the
adjacent part of Mull, and 50 continues, except in its quoad saera relations

The local features of the island alluded to by Adamnan are but few, and inc-ident-
ally mentioned3 they are as follows: Allzcm'teb Magna (107); Mons qul? monasterio
eminus swereminet (58); Montz'cellzcs monasterio supereminens (z3z); sslonticellzcs qm'

Arehdeaeon Monro speaks of “ a monastery of mounokes, and ane uther of mins,
with a parocho kirke, and sundrie uther ehapells.’' The Description‚ 1693, ‘tells of
“many chapells3’' and another old authority says, “in this island are many other
small ehapells'’³. Dr. Johnson and Mr. Boswell, in 1773, state that St. Oran‘s ehapel
and four others were then standing, while three more were remembered. The 00111-
piler of the Orig. Paroch. conjectures that the four here spoken of may refer to the
four small chapels within the ehoir of the cathedral (vol. ii. 1). 300); but it is unne-
eessary to have reeom‘se to portions of the prineipal chureh.

1. St. Oran's ChapeL sit-uate 111 the 111-1110111111 eemetery, called the Reilig Odhrain.
This is the oldest structure remaining 'm the island, and is referable to the close of the
eleventh century. It is a plain oblong, measuring ²9 feet 8 by 15.10 in the clear-¹.
Has no east window, but, instead, two narrow lights in the side walls near the eastern
angles, that 111 the north 2 feet high, that in the south 3 feet. It is roofless, and the
walls are fast deeaying. The great object of interest is the Romanesque circular—
headed west door, deeorated with what is called the beak-head ornament. This
building was probably the “ Zarqer Columcille chape1,'⁷ and the result of Queen Marga-
ret’s liberality.
