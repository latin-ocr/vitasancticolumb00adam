lumba (iii. 11, infra), probably at Prime. So usque ad natale Senioris mei non obiturus ero:

also that of bishop Columbanus (iii. 127infra).
On the present occasion the chief commemora·
tion of St. Columba was reserved till noon.

⁵ Natalis Columbae et Baithenei.—-That is, the
ninth of June. St. Bastbene, the immediate
successor of St. Columba, was his first cousin,
being son of Brendan, brother of Fedhlimidh¹
He was younger than St. Columba, being only
sixty-six years of age at his death, which oc-
curred in 599, after a presidency of three years.
His acts are preserved in the Codex Salmanti-
censis at Brussels (fol. 201), from which they
were printed by the Bollandists immediately
after those of St. Columba. (minii, tom. ii. pp.
236-238.) In them we find the following allu-
sion to the coincidence of his and St. Columba's
festival: “ Tertia feria, dum S. Baithinus in
ecclesia juxta altare Dominum oraret, sopor
pene mortis super eum illic cecidit: cum autem
Fratres cirea eum lamentarentur, Diermitius
minister Columbae, ait: Ecce, Fratres, videtis,
quod inter duas solennitates seniorum vestro-
rum magnum intervallum non erit. Haec eo
dicente Baithinus, qnasi de gravi somno exci-
tatus ait; Si inveni gratiam in oculis Dei, et si
cursum perfectum in conspectu ejus consum-
maverim usque hodie; ego confido in eo. quod

quod sie fere post sex dies factum est.''--e. 10
(Jun. ii. p. 238 α). The joint festival is thus
noticed in the Feilire of AEngns, June 9:

³ Bis vastaverat.—The disease here referred
to belonged to the class called by the Irish
ὃοὶοῃ hume, ⁶ yellow disorder‚' and was
known by the specific name Onon Chonmll,
or buibe Chonmu. In Britain it bore the
name of Vdd Velen, and was commonly called
the ‘Yellow Plague.' (Lhuyd, Archaeol. voe.
Conail.) “Flava pestis, quam et Physici ic-
tei-iciam dicunt passionem.” (Girald. Cambr.
