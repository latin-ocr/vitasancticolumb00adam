sem'eeable to the teaeher when the pupil ascended the throne. The “ war of Ecgfi·id”¹¹‚
as Adamnan terms the fatal expedition against the Piets in 685, restored Aldffld to his
country and the enjoyment of 1115 hereditary rights, so that when the abbot of Hy, in
the following year, went on a 1111551011 to the Northumbrian court, probably to plead
for the Irish captives whom Eegfirid's general had carried away from Meath, he found
a ready answer to his petition. It may be that he undertook the errand at the instance
of king Finnaehta, on whose patrimonia] tenitory the descent had been made by the
Saxons, possibly at the instance of the Leinstermen. The circumstances of Adam-
nan's journey are thus related in his Irish Life, but manifestly with that 1005011055, and
disregard of historica] precision, which characterize the later hagiology of Ireland:
‘¹ The north Saxons went to Erin and plundered Mag-h Bregh as far as Bealaeh-duim
and they carried off with them a great prey of men and women. The nien of Erin he—
sought of Adamnan to go in quest of the captives to Saxonland. Adamnan went to
demand the prisonem, and put in at Tracht-Romrak. The strand is long, and the
flood rapid3 so rapid that if the best steed in Saxonland, ridden hythe best horsenian,
were to start from the edge of the tide when the tide begins to flow, he could only
bring his rider ashore by swimming, so extensive is the strand, and so impetuous is
the tide. The Saxeus now were unwiHing to permit Adamnan to land upon the shore.
Push your ouraehs on the shore, said Adamnan to his people, for both their land and
sea are obedient to God, and nothing ean be done without God's permission. The
eleries did as they were told. Adaninan drew a circle with his erozier around the eur-
110115, and God rendered the strand firm under their euraehs, and he formed a high
wall of the sea about them, so that the place where thoy were was an island, and the
sea went to her limits past it, and did them no injury. WVhen tho Saxons had obser-ved
this very great miraele, they trembled for sear of Adamnan, and they gave him his

the Snxons, the illustrious wise man, the foster son same year (704) with Adamnan's. Bede assigns it
to 705. Riaguil of Bangor is not notieed in the
Annals„ but his day is in the calendar, at June 11.

'¹ War of Ecysrid.--See p. 186, infra. The 1301-
landist editor thought that Adamnan's first visit tn

Saxonland was for the purpose of pleading with

of Adamnan 3 of whom Riaguil of Bennchor sung:

To duy Bruide fights a battle
About the land of 1115 grandfather.
k'nless it be ton much to ask of the Son os God.
May he not pel-ish ’111 it.
To day the sun of Ossa falls
In battle with green swords.
Although he did his penance.
And shall lie in Hi mer his death,
'ro-(lay the son of Ossa falls,
Whu had the brown drinks.
Christ hus heard our supplication.
He wiu savo the smemlid Bruide.”

dently confounds Aldsrid with Ecgfrid¹ as regards
the battle. Tighemach places Aldsrid’s death in the
