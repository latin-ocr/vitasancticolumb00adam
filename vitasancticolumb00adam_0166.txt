Arabum-Hit. (Elpo enom ¹ altitudo
amoena.' The name exists in Ireland, as be-
longing to a parish in the county of Down, in
the form Ardlxeen, but has been lost in the Ethica
terra or Tiree. A spot on the north side of the
island, a little south-east of the farm-house
of Basphetrish, is called Ardkirhnish, where a
ehapel and cemetery are known to have for-
merly existed. ln the farm of Kenoway‚ south-
west of Balphetrish, is a rocky space called
Kiffiunian, having faint vestiges of a small
huilding lying east and west. See the paper
on the Island of Tiree in the Ulster Journal of
Archaeology, vol. ii. p. 241, and map. T. 1nnes,
who erroneously supposed the Terra Ethica to
be Shetland (Civ. Eccl. Hist. pp. 204, 205),
seems to have been satisfied of his correct-
ness, sor he four times makes mention of “Art-
chain in Shetland.'’ (Ibid. pp. 179—181.)

l· Supra memoratus—This refers to the titu-
lus, which the Bollandists omit¹ and thereby
mutilate the text. Instances of this kind are
frequent in the course of the Life.

Ε Findchanus.—Colgan assigns his festival to
March 11, choosing that one from the five se-
veral days at which the name occurs in the

Irish calendar, because on it Marian Gor-
man commemorates pinnehen δθῑ oc δῃαιῡ-
nech, Findchanus vit-qo, purus et amarosus5
and the Martyrology of Tamhlacht, pinnehen
amc 1 pmemh, Finnclzanus quisuic in anqustiis
(sive cruciatibus) dinturnis : the expressions
of suffering having reference, as he supposeS‚
to the visitation recorded at the close os this
chapter. (Act. SS. p. 584 b, n. 2.) Tiree was,
in early times, greatly resorted to by Irish ec-
elesiastics. Besides the immediate followers
of St. Columba, it was visited by St. Brendan,
St. Cainneeh, st. Comgall, St. Colmanela;
and on the present occasion St. Findchan
‘¹ brought Aidus Niger with him from Scotia
to Britain,” to his monastery on the island.
Among the lowland Scotch this saint is eom-
monly called St. Fink, and his name is pre-
served in Kilfinichen, a parish in the island of
Mull, situate between Lochs Na Keal and Scri-
dan3 which is noticed in records under the
forms Keilfeinchen, Killinaclzan‚ and Killinchen.
The Sancta Fiueana, proposed in the Origines
Parochiales as the patron of this par-ish, seems
scarcely possessed of equal elaims with St.
Findchan. (vol. ii. pt. i. p. 3¹4)

⁴1 Aidum Nigrum—Genti oubh of the Irish.
He was son of Suibhne, and was chief of the
Dal Araidhe in 565. In 581 he became king of
