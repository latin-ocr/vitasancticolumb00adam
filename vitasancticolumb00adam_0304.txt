Amo in tempore, quidam ²Hiberniensis peregrinus ad Sanctum perve-
niens, per aliquot apud eum menses in 3Ιοιιῑι ⁴commanebat insula. Cui vir
beatus alia die, Nunc, ait, quidam de ⁶pr0vincialibus ''tuis clericis ad coelum
ab angelis portatur, cujus adhuc ignoro nomen. Frater vero hoc audiens
coepit secum de ¹³provincia perscrutari Ante1·iorum³‚ ⁹qui Scotice ¹⁰ Indairthirb

intulit verbum, ¹³inquiens‚ Alium Christi scio “militonem qui sibi in eodem

ditum est, qui deinceps Odrani sepulclzretum
est appellatus.‘' It is a remarkable fact that
the principal, and now only cemetery in Hy is
called the Reiliy Orain, after him instead ofthe
patron saint, and has been so for many centu-
ries3 sor in the gloss to the Feilire of AEngus,
at St. Odhran's commemoration¹ Oct. 27, it is
observed‚ o hl Cholmm ciue .ι. Rehc Οὸῃοιη,
⁵ of Hy Colaim-eille, .ι. of Relic Odhrain.' Pro-
bably Odhran was the first of St. Columba’s fra-
ternity who was interi-ed in the island, and the
whole island being called after the patron, the
cemetery took its name from the first kinsman
of his community who was buried in itd. The
story had not lost in its carriage when it was
told to Pennant, and the late Hon. A. Herbert
has revived it in a way which will surprise if it
does not convince. See his Peculiarities of Cul-
deism, British Magazine, vol. xxvi. p. 10; Irish
Nenuius, p. xxv. See also the drawings of St.
Oran's chapel¹ a building of the twelfth cen-
tury, but the oldest now remaining in the island,
and of the Reilig‚ in Graham's Antiqq. of Iona,
plates 5, 6 (Lond. 1850).

‘b Indairtlzir.—This word is compounded of
m'o, an old form of the article in the nom. plu-
ral, which is usually joined to its noun (see
Zeuss, Gram. Celt. i. pp. 230, ²37 ; O'Donovan‚
Ir.Gr. p. 67), and Gmclnp, ‘Easterns.' Some-
times it appears in the early Annals in the form
no nClmchep, and sometimes, as An.UIt. 640,
in its equivalent Latin orientales. R] nu nGm-
clim, of Tigh. 722, is rex Orientalium in Au.
Ult. 721. Thus in the Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick, ΟἰνεΙιίν, id est orientalis, iii. 7¹ (Tr.
Th. p. 162 b). The people were so called, as
inhabiting 0111&er Οηιδιαῑῑ, East Oriel (Four
Mast. 1099). See the note, p. 83, snpra.

⁰ maruntium—Not expressly noticed in the
calendarS. Colgan conjectured that he was
“Diarmait, son of Meaehar, bishop of Airther-
magh in Tuath-ratha‚'' who is commemorated
at Jan. 16; but incorrectly, for Tuath-ratha is
now called Toora. and is part of the barony
of Magheraboy, in the county of Fermanagh;
