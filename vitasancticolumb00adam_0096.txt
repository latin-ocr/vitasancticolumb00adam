been on the confines of the Pictish and Scotic jurisdiction, so that while its tenure was
in a measure subject to the consent of either people, it formed amost oonvenient centre
for religious intercourse with both. The Scots were aJready Chn'stians in name; the
Picts were not. Hence the eonversion of the latter formed a grand project for the
exercise of missionary exerti0n‚ and St. Columba at once applied himself to the
task. He visited the king at his fortress'¹; and having surmounted the difficulties
which at first lay in his way, he won his estecm, overcame the opposition of his
ministersz and eventuully succeeded in planting Christianity on a permanent footing
in their province'. The possession of Hy was formafly granted, or substantially con-
finned, by this sovereign also; and the combined consent¹ to the occupation of it by St.

Conall, the lord of Dalriada, died in 5743, whereupon his cousin, Aidan, assumed
the sovereignty, and was formally inaugurated by St. Columba in the monastery of
Hyh. N ext year they both attendcd the convcntiou of Dmmcoatti, where the claims
af the Irish king to the homage of British Dalriada were abandoned, and the inde·
pendence of that province declared.

St. Brendan, of Clonfert, who had been a frequent tisitor of the western 13105, and on
one occasion had been a guest of St. Columba in Hi'mbak, died in 577 ; and St. Finnian,
