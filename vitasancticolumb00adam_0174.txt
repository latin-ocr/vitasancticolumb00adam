tiaci.¹ (ZeUSS, Gram. Celt. i. p. 278.) See
Fiech‘s Hymn, vs. 11; Petrie's Tara, p. 40. In
Mat. ii. ι, we have Onnoiee for ‘ Wise men.'
The memoirs of St. Patrick in the Book of Ar-
magh state that, at the time of his arrival,
the monarch of Ireland had sciv08‚ et mayos, ec
nurispz'ces, et incantatores, et omnis malae artis in-
ventores, in his service (fol. 2 b a).The contests
between St. Patrick and the Magi are related
at fol. 4⁰ α, διο. In an ancient hymn ascribed to
St. Columba we find the following sentiment :

¹ Christ the Son of God is my [It-uita·
(Miscell. Irish Archaeol. Suc. vol. i. p. 6.)

This word open is the origin of the term
Druides, and not δρῦς. as Pliny suggests (N. H.
xvi. 44), or gum, as Vossius. Concerning the
Magi and their vestiges among the Irish after
the establishment of Christianity, see Colgan,
Acta SS. p. 149 b, n. ¹5· On the word Druid see

by the quotation from the Psalms in iii. 23, infra,
which is stated to be from the 331·d‚ and which
is so in the Septuagint; but is the 34th in the
Hebrew.

³³ currui insidentem—The memoirs of St. Pa-
trick in the Book of Armagh make frequent
mention of his chariot (fol. 7 b a, 9 ba, 14 a b),
and even name his driver (fol. 11 ab. 13 b b).
St. Columba himself used such a conveyance in
Ireland (ii. 43, iufra). On the ancient currus
of the Irish, see O'Conor, Rer. Hib. Scriptor.
iv. p. 148. A spirited drawing of an ancient
cai· is given from a monument at Meigle in the
late lamented Patrick Chalmers’ Sculptured
Monuments of Augus. (Plate 18. Edinb. 1848.)

b Campum Brey.-—See ii. 39, iufra. Πὶςιδ
bne& sometimes latinized Breyz'a, is reputed
to have received its name from Bregha son of
Breogan, a Milesian chief. (Keating, Hist. i.
p. 286, Ed. Haliday.) The territory originally
compi-ised five triocha-clzeds, or eantreds, in the
east portion of ancient Meath. In after times
the name was applied to the extensive tract of
country reaching from Dublin northwards to
near Dundalk, and north-westwards to the
Fews Mountains. It is still preserved in the
territory, in the form Slieve Breyh, which be-
longs to a hill on the north-east of the county
of Meath. (Ord. Surv. s. 13·)
