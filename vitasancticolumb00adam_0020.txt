tural emendations are often peculiarly unhappy, and his constant endeavour to
find a place in the Irish Calendar for Adamnan’s worthies sometimes tempts
him into misspent labour.

Stephen White furnished a copy to the Bollandistse also, from which the
text was again printed, in 1698, under the editorial care of Francis Baert, but
in a less faithful form than the previous one. The editor took many liberties
with the copy, changing the division of the Chapters, introducing new titles,
displacing the original ones, and occasionally altering' the text. The notes
which he has added are principally from Colgan, and are neither as rich nor

erudite as his materials might have led one to expect.
The next publication of the Life was the reprint of Canisius's Lectiones
in Basnage’s Thesaurusf‚ in the first volume of which it is reproduced in its

earlier defective form.

Lastly, it appeared, in 1789, in Pinkerton's collection& a work of much
smaller dimensions, and which might have had a wide circulation but for a

whim of the editor, who limited the impression to a hundred copiesh.

The

text of Adamnan in this work professes to follow a manuscript preserved in
