psalniodiae viri indubitanter traditum est. Quae scilicet vox venerabilis viri in
ecclesia cum fratribus decantantis, aliquando per quatuor stadia, hoc est, quiu-
gentos passus, aliquando vero per octo, hoc est, mille passus, incomparabili
elevata modo audiebaturs. Mirum dictu! Nec in auribus eorum qui secum
in ecclesia stabant vox ejus modum humanae vocis in clamoris granditate exce-
debat. Sed tamen eadem hora qui ultra mille passuum longinquitatem stabant,
sic clare eandem audiebant vocem, ut illos quos canebat versiculos etiam per
singulas possent distinguere syllabas: similiter 1²enim ejus vox in auribus
prope et longe audientium personabat. Sed hoc de voce miraculum beati viri
non semper, sed raro, accidisse comprobatum quod tamen sine Divini Spiritus
gratia nullo modo fieri potuisset.

vocis ejus sublevatione juxta Brudei regis munitionemg accidisse traditur.
Nam ipse Sanctus cum paucis statribus extra regis munitionem dum vesperti-
nales Dei laudes ex more celebrareth, quidam Magi& ad eos propius aecedentes,
in quantum poterant, prohibere conabantur, ne de ore ipsorum divinae laudis
sonus inter Gentiles audiretur populos. Quo comperto Sanctus quadragesi-

‘Anthemium—The following anecdote illus-
trative of the power of S. Columba’s voice, even
in his boyhood, is told in the ancient Irish Life
preserved in the Book of Lismore, Leabhar
Breac. and Highland Society MS. : “At another
time he went to watch by a sick person. As
they were passing through a thicket, the foot
of the cleric [who attended him] slipped on the
path ; upon which he suddenly died. Columcille
put his hood under the cleric's head, thinking
that he was asleep. And he began to rehearse
his lesson, so that he was he heard by certain
nuns in their convent. The learned estimate
that there was a mile and a half between them;
and the sound of hi's voice was often heard at
that distance, ut dixit .-

Son o δοέα Coluim cstte

omme peimeno eoo bo neilt.

&The sountl of the voice of Colum-cille,
Great its sweetness above au clerics:
To the end of fifteen-hundred paces,
Though great the distance. it was distinctly heard: '¹

ἓ Brudei reyis munitionem-From ii. 33 we
learn that this was situate near the north-east
end of Loch Ness. In ii. 35 an account is given
of the Saint's firstjourney to Brudeus, to which
it is probable that the present anecdote is to be
referred, See the notes there.

¹¹ celebraret—So, at the close of his life,
‘⁴ Sanctus ad vespertinalem Dominicae noetis
missam ingreditur ecclesiam.”-iii. 23, infra.

¹ Mayz'.—This is the Latin word always used
in the acts of the Irish saints as equivalent
to the vernacular term opums& Druids, or
onum, as in earlier compositions. Thus, in the
Irish MS. of St. Paul’s Epistles, at Wurtzburg.
