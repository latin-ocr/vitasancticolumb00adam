'e Ad januam stantes-It appears from the
present passage, and those referred to in the
preceding note, that St. Columba, when sitting
iu ὴίεᾸᾳεΙΙ, was attended by one or two os the
commuuity, who either stood without, in rea-
diness to receive his orders, or were engaged
with him in his studies within.

s lllaynae ‹imaus—Probably the majoris domus
fabrica, which was erected in Durrow while
Laisre, son of Feradhach, presided there (i. 29,
p. 58, supra). In the titulus of the present
chapter it is called monasterium rotundum.
Concerning the author's meaning, Dr. Petrie
fairly argues that it was ‘⁴ Not, certainly, that,
the monastery itself had a rotund roos, because
we know that the monasteries of those days
were a collection of small and detached cells,
each devoted to a single monk; and certainly
not that the church had one, as it appears from
the notice iu the text of the chapter that the

sides, from the quadrangular forms of all the
Irish churches of this period, they could not¹
have admitted ofa dome roos. But more than
all, supposing it were from the roof of the
church that the monk was falling, or from any
other building, such as we know-to have existed
in connexion with the monasteries of this period,
the Tower excepted, where would have been the
danger, to escape which, the miraculous inter-
position of au ange] would have become neces-
sary ¹? Surely not to prevent him from a fan of
twclve feet or so, which is the usual height of
the side walls of the abbey—churches of this pe-
riod; nor from the roofs of either the abbot's
house or monks' cells, which, though usually
round, were seldom, if ever. ofa greater height
than twelve feet, aud from which, having rarely
upright walls there could have been no serious
danger in falling. In short the miracle, to be
a miracle at all, requires the suppositiou that
the round roos on which the brother was at
work must have been that of a building of
great altitude, and from which a fall would be
necessarily productive of certain death,—such
a building. iu fact, as a Round Tower. which
was the only oue os the kind the Irish had,
either in those days, or sor many ages aster-

sent chapter of Adamnan supplies a most
valuable link in the history of the Round
Towers3 it points to their primary use as mo-
nastic abodes, known by the name Monaslerium
Rotundum, and regarded as belonging to a class
of building called maqna or major domus, as
