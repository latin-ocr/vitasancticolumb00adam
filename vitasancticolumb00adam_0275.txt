But St. Aidus performed a greater wonder
than either: “Pergens ad castra 11111111οηίοη-

et currus altera rota sine impedimento curre-
bat sub sancto Dei⁷ suffultus Divino nutu.''—
Vit. 0. 7 (Colg. Act. SS. p. 4¹9 α).

¹¹ Scripsisse sufficiat—Here the. codd. of the
shorter recension terminate the second 110011,
with the observation: “ animadvertere Lector
debet, quod et de compertis in eo multa propter
legentium praetermissa sunt fastidium.”

iDe carne transitum—Some of his posthu-
mous powers have been related in i. 1 (pp. ¹3,
17) supra.

Λ Annos quatuordecim-The drought herc
mentioned was probably partial: had it been
generally felt in 1reland, the 1111011110011 is that
it would have been recorded in the Annals, and
thus means have been afforded of calculating
exactly the date of Adamnan's writing. Tigh-
ernach at 714, and the Annals of Ulster at 713,
record a siccitas ηιαφιιι, but this cannot refer
to 1110 visitation mentioned in the text, for
Adamnau died in 704. The substance of this
chapter is briefly related in Cummian's Life,
where it 15 prefaced, ‘⁸ Post mortem viri Dei.''
Now ifthis be a genuine work, and if the writer
be Cuimine Ailbe, it will follow that the present

chapter of Adamnan was written between ⁶79
and 683 z for Cummian, who relates the occur-
rence⁷ died in 669, therefore that is the latest
date to which we can add the ¹4 years in the
text, which brings us to 683, four years after
Adamnan’s elevation to the abbacy of Hy.

bLevitico [ὦπα-011011. xxvi. 19, 20. The
reading in the text agrees exactly with that in
the Vulgate.

Π seminatum—It appears in the sequel that
this had been done at the end os April or be-
ginning of May, so that we may 0000111110 that
agricultural operations were conducted in that
age at an earlier time of the year than they
now are. See chap. 3 (p. 107) supra.
