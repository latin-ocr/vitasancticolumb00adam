the British Museum 3 but the editor, who made the text of Canisius the basis
of his collation, has very often neglected his professecl exemplar, and fallen in
with the old readings of the W'indbcrg‚ instead of the British‚ manuscript.
On the whole, the text is certainly an improvement on that in the Canisian
family, but is greatly inferior to Colgan's, with which the editor seems to have
been unacquainted*‚ for he supplies the deficiency at the connnencement of
the British manuscript from Canisius’s meagre authority, and, when he might
have drawn from Colgan’s rich store, he adds a few foot notes, which do more
to prove the editorial incompetency of the commentator than to illustrate the
text of his author.

All who have compared the text of Adamnan as given by Canisius or his
copyists‚ with that in Colgan, the Bollandists‚ or Pinkert.on‚ have observed a
great difference in their length. Ussher noticed the brevity of Canisius’s
compared with the Cotton and Reichenau MSS& so did Colgan and Pin-·
kerton 3 and Dr. Lanigan¹ has gone so far as to state it to be his opinion that
the shorter text was the genuine production of Adamnan, and that the longer
one owed its difference to a later hand. In deciding, therefore, between the
recensions‚ the question is one of abridgment or interpolation.
sumption in favour of the longer text arises from the fact that it is found in
the oldest and most respectable manuscript, as well as in two others of totally in-

did know, for Edward Gibbon, Bishop Pcrcy,
Thorkelin‚ and Tyrwhitt arc on the list), that
neither Surius nor Mabillon ever printed a line
of this work of Adamnan; that the Trias was
the work of John Colgan, not of Stephen White;
that Francis Baert was not the editor of the
2nd June vol. of the Acta Sanctorum, but only
one of four who parted the labour among them;
that no such writers as Vicus or Gonon are
known to sanctology; andthat Gonon gave only
ashort abstract “ex illa. prolixa [Vita] quam
scripsit Adamannus.’· Had Pinkerton con-
suited Colgan and the Bollandists he might
easily have produced a better book.
