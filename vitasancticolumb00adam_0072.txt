for believing that the public mind, which had for some time been kept in expectation
and alarin by the discases which prevailed, and the portents which were observed or
imagincd, was advantageously impressed, and seriously disposed, by the relation of a
vision, concerning the j ovs of heaven and the pains of hell, which Adamnan is said to
have witnessed previous to the date of the above synod. The Fip Goamnom, or
Vz'sz‘on of Adamnmz, an Irish composition of considerable age, as is proved by its style,
is still in existenc03 and though possessing internal evidence that in its present form¹²
it is not the production of Adamnan, it lays claim to considerable antiquity⁰‚ and em-
bodies a narrative which, like the visions of St. Fursap, passed current in conversation
as the realities of his experience. The Visionq is a religious discourse on the text
Psal. cxlvi. 5, 6 (Vulg.), and after some prefatory remarks, goes on to say: “ After
this, that which is prcaehed here was manifested to Adamnan Ua Tinne, the high sago
of the western world, when 1115 50111 passed froin his body on the festival of John 1110
Baptist‘, and when it was carried to heaven to behold the angels there, and to hell to
behold its wretched 110515.” Having related all that 110 witnessed in cithcr abode, and
having specially noticed in the place of torment the “Aircinnechs, who, in the pre-
sence of the reliess of the saints, administer the gifts and tithes of Godt, but who 111111
the profits to their own private ends fiom the strangers and poor of the Lord,'’ whom
he elsewhere brands as “sensual An·einneehs‚'' the narrative proceeds to say that

These canons do not seem to have any connexionwith
the Cain Adlmmlmaz'n. Mal-tene printed the canones

Adamnani, with other Irish Canens, from 5 MS.
of the Bigot Library at Rotterdam, which formerly
belonged to the Monastery of Fescamp, in Nor-
mandy (Thes. Nov. Anecd. tom. iv. eol. 18, Lut.
Par. 17 17). They exist 5150 in the Cotton MS. of
Canons (fol. 155 b), but with considerable varia-
tiens, under the title Incipiunt Uonones Adomnam'.
Mention is made at p. 179, infra, osa transcript of
them. Resides 111050, there is in Martene a detached
canon, nuder 1110 title Item Adnmpnanus (lb. col.
1 1). It is of the same pulport as the others, namely,
unclean fond, and it exists in the Cotton MS„ but
without Adanman’s name (Otho Ε. xiii. sol. 126 b).

¹ John the Baptist.-The second part of Adam-
nan's Vision contains instructions for averting the
mortality that was apprehended on the feast of the
Decollation of John the Baptist (Aug. 29). The
note on the Feilire of Aengus at this day states that
the Scuab α Fanni! (Besom of Fanad) was 5 plague
which was to visit Irelaud in the latter times, in
revenge for the beheading of John the Baptist, as
prophesied by Columciue, Moling, and Aireran.

prediction concerning the Scuub Fanait 10 Bec mac
