extern tribes injured Erin. They continued thus for a long period, and even to the.
time of Adamnan. He was the ninth abbot who succeeded to the government of Ia
after columcille.

“A great spoil was carried off by the Saxons from Erin. Adamnan went to demand
a restitution of the spoil, as Bede relatos in his history. The greater part of the
hishops ofall Emope assembled to condemn Adamnan for having celebrated Easter
after the fashion of Columcille, and for having upon him the tonsure of Simon Magus,
i. e. ab aare ad aurem. Bede saysg that though many were the wisc men inthat synod,
Adamnan excelled them all in wisdom and eloquence; and Adamnan said, It was not in
imitation of Simon Magus that 110 had this tonsure, but in imitation of John of the
Breasth, the foster-son of the Redeemcr, and that this was the tonsure which he had .
upon him, and that though Peter lovcd thc Savioun the 811110111- loved John; and that
it was on tho f'ourteenth of the moon of April, on whatever day of the wcek that should
fall, the Apostles celebrated Easter. Then an old senior rising up said, Though Co-
lumcille himself were present here, we would not leave him until he should be of the
same rule with ourselves; but you we will not quit, until you be of the same rule
with ourselves. Adamnan made answer unto him and said, I shall be of the same rule
with you. Be tonsured therefore, accordingly, said the bishops It will be sufficient
that Ι (10 so, said Adamnan, at my own monastery. No, said they, but immediately.
Adamnan was then tonsured, and 110 greater honour was ever shown to man than was
given to Adamnan on this occasion ; and that great spoil was restored to him, and he
came straight home to his own monastery of Ia. It was a great surprise to his con-
gregation to see him with that tonsure. He then requested of the congregation to
receive the tonsure, but they refused, and he got nothing from them, sed Deuae permisit
conventui peecare, ile. ipsum Adamnammc capellare& qui misertus est Hiberniae. Sic
Beda disi& for Bede was along with Adamnan. Now Adamnan came afterwards to
Erin, and his fame spread throughout the land, but that one regulation of Easter and
of the tonsure was not received fiom him until this year, anno Domini 696, and Adam-
nan died in the year 703, in the 78th year of his age.”

Bede records the last stage in our saint’s life, ‘⁴ Qui cum celebrato in Hibernia ca-
nonico pascha, ad suam insulam revertisset, suoque monasterio catholicam temporis
paschalis observantiam instantissime praedicaret, nec tamen perficere quod conabatur
posset, contigit eum ante expletum anni circulum migrasse de saeculo. Divina utique
