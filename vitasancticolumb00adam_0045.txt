VI. Codex S. A sinall quarto manuscript on vellum, of the early part of
the ninth century, preserved in the Library of St. Gall, No. 555. It consists
of 83 folios‚ and contains the text of the shorter recension. The writing,
which is represented in Plate IV. No. 2, is poor, and, as Dean Greith states,
“literis Carolinis saec. ix. scriptus, mendis et naevis scatet, ideoque plurimis
in locis correctus appa1·et.’' On the last page is the figure of St. Columba, ot
which a facsimile is given in Plate V. T he catalogue of the library ot St.
Gall, which was written in the ninth century, and is still preserved, mentions
a Vita sancti Columba} in („'od.1'.; and in a much later catalogue, that of
lVeidmanm formerly librarian of St. Gall, that Vita is reported to be still in
existence. Haenel says of it: ‘⁶ Vita S. Columbae eod. membranaceus, pul-
chre scriptus. In fine imago S. Columbae. Reperitur in catalogo Bibliothecae
saec. ix.'’ (Catalogi Libror. MSS. ἄσῃ, col. 697, Lips. 1830). For the various
readings of this manuscript, the editor is indebted to the Very Rev. Charles
Greith, Dean of St. Gall.

VH. Codex Cottonianus. This copy of the Life is contained in a large
solio volume, which formerly belonged to Sir Robert Cotton, and is now to
be found in the British Museum, under the mark Bihl. Cotton. Tiberius,
D. ῖὶἰ. It is a vellum manuscript in double columns, written in a fine large
hand, of the latter part of the twelfth century. It contained, according to
SinithS, sixty-eight tracts, principally Lives of Saints3 and, among these, the
forty-seventh was Vita Sancti Colnmbe episcopi. With other manuscripts of
the Cotton Libmry, it suffered considerable damage in the fire of 1731, and
from that time until 1852 was unemployed, being reported in the Cataloguc'
as ‘⁶ A folio volume on vellum, burnt to a ciust, which is preserved in a case?
However, by the direction of Sir Frederick Maddenu, and under his judicious
superintendence, the leaves which had been consolidated were disengaged,
flattened‚ and inlaid, and the volume once more made available for refer-
ence. Unfortunately, the editor was not aware of the existence of this
manuscript at the time that he was collating the other copies, so that, its
