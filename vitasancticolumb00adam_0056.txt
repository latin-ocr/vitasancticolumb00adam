copious abstraet² of this compilation in Latin, preserving the principal parti-
culars of the narrative, but omitting the outrageously fabulous portions³‚ as
well as those which were not in accordance with his ecclesiastical feelings¹³3
and divided the whole into three books, agreeing with the three chief eras of
the Saint’s life:-.1. From his birth to the battle of Cooldrevny. 2. From
¹that event, as the cause of his departure> from Ireland, to his temporary return
to attend the convention of Drumceatt. 3. From the convention of Drum-
ceatt to his death. This compilation is important as a dcpository of all the
existing traditions concerning St. Columba, but it throws no real light on
Adamnan, either in solving a difficulty, or identifying a place03 and its great
prolixity only serves to show how much superior Adamnan’s memoir is to any
other record professing to be an account of the Saint's life : and, after all, how
little historical matter has been added to that work by the utmost endeavours
of those best qualified to succeed in the attempt. To Adamnan is, indeed,
owing the historic precision, and the intelligible operation, which eharacterize
the second stage of the ancient Irish Church. In the absence of his memoir,
the Life of St. Columba would degenerate into the fogg ', unreal, species os
narrative which belongs to the Lives of his contemporaries, and we should
be entirely in the dark on many points of discipline and belief, concerning
which we have now a considerable amount of satisfactory information.

Adamnan’s memoir is, therefore, to be prized as an inestimable literar)-
relic of the Irish Church: perhaps, with all its defects, the most valuable
monument of that institution which has escaped the ravages of time. The
editor, at least, felt it to be so: and has therefore taken great pains, in the
midst of many difficulties and discouragementS, to call into his service all the
means of illustration which books, places, and men could afford.

that has been done. to restore the text to its purity has already been
stated. It may be added that the Glossargh which belongs to this depart-
ment of the work, exhibits many vocables not noticed hy Du Cange or his
