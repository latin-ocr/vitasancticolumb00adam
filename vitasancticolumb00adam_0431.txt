by the same king in 1 21 1-12143 and substantially repeated in a eonfirmationn by King
Alexander II. in 1214-1218. In 1314 the convent grants to Malcoim of Monimusk
“ totam terram nostram de Forglen que pertinet ad Bracbennach eum omnibus pertin·
enciis suis una eum jure patronatus ecclesie ejusdem terre ..... Dictus vero Mal-
colmus et heredes sui facient in exercitu domini Regis nomine nostro servicium pro
dicta terra quod pertinet ad Bracbennaeh quociens opus fuerit''⁰. From the Moni-
musks the lands of Forglen, with the custody of the Bracbennach, passed by 11111011-
tance to the Urrys and the Frasers, in the latter of which families they were found in
1388. In 141 1 they were surrendered to the convent, and about 1420 they were cou-
ferred on Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum. In 1457 they had passed to his grandson,
who held them of the abbot and convent by service of ward and relief, and “ ferendi
vexillum de Brekbennach in exercitu Regis,'' and the payment of the annual rent of
40 shiffingsv. In 1481 Alexander Im'ne did homage for these lands and purtenanees
to the abbot, who “ dixit et constituit ut tenentes regalitatis dicti monasterii de Aber-
brothoc ubicumque existentes cum dicto Alexandro ad exereitum domini nostri Regis
sub le Brecbennoch videlieet sub vexillo dictorum abbatis et conventus meabunt et
equitabunt cum requisiti fuerint per dictum dominum abbatem et conventum dicti mo-
nasterii et suos successores pro defensione Regis et regni''⁴³. In 148 3 Alexander Irvine
had a charter of the lands of Forglen, with the advowson of the chureh ‘¹ faciendo in
exercitu domini nostri Regis servicium de le Brekbannaeh debitum et consuetum‘⁷s,
And lastly‚ in 1494 it was found that Alexander Irvine was the lawful heir of Alex-
ander Irvine of Drum, his father, in the lands of Forglcn. with the advowson of the
chureh, held as above& From these notices we learn that this reliquary was a banner,
and held so sacred in the beginning of the thirteenth century that it was named in tho
dedication clause of the earliest charter. Α150, that it was eoupled with S. Columba's
name, not because the abbcy of Arbroath was under his invocation, for it was under
that of St. Thomas of Cantcrbury; nor because he was patron saint of the parish, for
St. Adanmant was reputed to be so; but, as we may conceive, because this banner was
in some way connected with St. Columba’s history, either by use or blessing. Possibly
it was like thc Vem'llmn Sancti Cuthbertc‘u, so fatal to the Scots at Neville's Cross.
“Ther did appeare to Johne Fossour, the Prior of the Abbey at Durham, a vision
commanding him to take the holie Corporax Cloth, which was within the corporax‚
