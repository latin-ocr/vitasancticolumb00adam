at 380, 582, 590, 596, 600, 606. His successor was his younger son, Eochaidh
Buidhe, the Eclzodz'ua Bm'de of Adamnan (36). Six kings of the family of Eochaidh
successively occupied the throne. But the battle of Magh Rath, which was fought
in 637, by Domhnall Breac, greatly weakened the kingdom, and the power os the
family declined until 689, when the soeptre passed to the house of Loarn, in the
person of Ferchar Fada (203). The supremacy remained with the house of Loarn
for some time, but eventually was resumed by the raee of Gabhran, from which
the genealogies derive the descent of Kenneth Mae Alpin, the annexer of Pictland,
and his line, down to Alexander mac Alexander, the last male representative. On
the other hand, from Ferehar Fada were deseended the ancient Momaors, or Stewards,
of Moray, the senior representatives of the race. From him also came the powerful
families of the Clann Guaz're or Maequarries, and Clann Fc'omzyzcz'n or Machinnons,
and of whom there were such numerous monuments in Hy and Tiree. From Fer-
char Fada came also the great family ofrllac Coimzfflz or Mackenzie⁵, in whom the.
lordships of Seaforth and Kintal were afterwards vested. From him also came the

son of Gabhran, king of Alba, was the mother of

derived its name, aocording to the ancient pedigree
of Mac Leod, from Monach Mor, son of Balbuadh
Innse Tile [of Thule, or Iceland]v monach mon
o nomen Oun Πῖοηωδ, ‘Monach Mor, from
whom Dun Monaigh is named’ (Mac Firbis, Geneal.
MS. p. 776). With this agrees the modern Scotch
account. ‘⁸ In Argyleshire, a tradition prevails that
a Danish or Nox-wegian prinee of the name of Moni,
having lauded in the district of Crinan, (still known
as the Pass of Moni‚) and laid waste the country,
was afterwards attacked by the native inhabitants,
who routed his troops, and pursued him and a few of
his followens, who with difficulty regained their
shipS, aud fied northwards toward Lochaber. Having
reached Craigmoni [a rocky hill near Glen Urqu-
hart in Inverness, encircled on the top with rude
walls of stone]‚ and established himself in the ad-
joining valley‚ still called Daimoni‚ this son of the
king of Lochlin or Norway, as he is styled in the

country, seems afterwards to have been driven fai-ther
up into the interior, and to have perished at (3011)*-
mony or Cois-amboni, the valley of Moni, where his
grave [cave P] (Uai alstani) is still to be seers'

Duntroon is on the north side of Loch Crinau, and,
near that Loch, DumMonaidh, the seat of the Dal-

¹· Exercitus-Mt. Skene, who has devoted more
consideration to this part of history, andis, perhaps,
better qualified to pronounce an opinion on the sub-
ject, than any person living, believes that AEdan was
the then Gwlediq, or ‘Dux bellator‚’ of the confeder-
ate Scots and Britons against the Saxous, whose
official seat was at Eiddyn, or Etin (202), and that
he thus came to have the command of so large an
army (Letter, Apr. ¹9¹ 1853).

the family derives its name from a Kenneth F itz-
Gerald, but the Gaelic pedigree is opposed to it.
