writingsu. Adamnan’s two remaining Latin works give proof of his classical attain-
ments, and Cummian‘s Pascha] Epistlev is a remarkable specimen of the ecclesiastical
learning of the day. To the English students who frequented Ireland in the seventh
century, the natives supplied libros ad leqmzdmnr, and Hy was not likely to fall short
in its literary provision. For collective reading, they were probany furnished with
the lives of saints (Adamnan quotes Sulpicius Severus’ Life of St. Martin (3), and Con-
stant-ine's Life of St. Germanus (149))‚ which were collected in a maletum& auditis very
likely that for this kind of reading the life of the founder, as written by Adamnan, was
reduced to the form in which it is found in the shorter recension, where the titles of
the chaptcrs, and most proper names are omitted, as calculated to interrupt or cneum-
ber the tenor of the narrative. St. Benediet prcscribed the reading, after supper, of
collationes 1ϊῖ vitan Patrum, aut certe aliquid quod (edificet audientes (cap. 42).

WVriting formed a most important part of the monastic occupations; the founder
was much devoted to it (143, 21 ς, z 33), and many of his books were preserved (116,
1 17, 175). His successor also practised it (53, ²33)- Besides the supply
of service books for the numerous ehurchcs that sprung into existence,
and which, probably, were wn‘tten without embellishment, great labour
was bestowed upon the ornamentation of some manuscripts, especially the saon-d
writing83 and the Books of Kells and Dum-ow are wonderful monuments of the eon-
ception, the skill, and the patience of the Columbian scribes in the seventh century.
Giraldus Cambrensis’s5 glowing description of the Gospels of Kildare is hardly strong
enough to express the excellencies of the Book of Kells. Of their ordinary Latin hand
in the eighth century, Cod. A. of Adanman is a fine specimen¹. This manuscript eon-

Irish words entered in the margin. The other is
