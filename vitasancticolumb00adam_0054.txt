VH. The latest and much the most copious collection of the Saint’s acts

is that by Manus O’Donnell, chief of Tir-Connell‚ which professes to be, and
is, a chronological digest. of all the existing records concerning the patron of
his family. His framework consists of Adamnan and the old Irish Life3 into
this he has worked 2—1. The historical allusions found in the volume ofpoemsk
ascribed to St. Columba3 2, The substance of the preface to the Amhra
Choluim-cille 3 3, Extracts from the prefaces to the Latin hymns ascribed to
St. Columba, and from the hymns themselves, as preserved in the Liber Hym-
norum3 4, Some notes from the comments on the Feilire ofAengus13 ς, The
matter in the poenis on Cormae Ua Liathainm3 6, Passages from the lives of
contemporary saints, especially St. Mochonna, or Machar, of Aberdeen¹¹3
7, The alleged prophecies of Berchan of Clonsast03 8, Some legendary
poenisp on the wanderings of certain Columbian monks, which far outdo St.
Breudan's Navigation in wildness of incident. O’Donnell’s statementq is : “Be
it known to the readers of the Life, that it was buried in oblivion for a long
time, and that there was not to be found, but a fragment of the book which
holy Adamnan compiled of it in Latin, and another small portionr in Irish,
compiled by the Irish poets in a very difficult dialect3 and the remainder in
legends scattered throughout the old books of Erin.” These materials, with
one or two trifling exceptions, all exist at the present day, and have more or
less been consultcd for the present work. It would be quite possible for a
good scholar and patient investigator, endowed with an inventive wit, and a
copious style, to compile from materials existing in the year of Grace 1 856, a
narrative to the full as circumstantiaL as diffuse, and as 1narvellouS‚ as that

¹ S17zal!porlion.—It appears from the contents
of O'Donnell's work that he had a perfect copy
of Adamnan and the entire ofthe old Irish Life,
but he calls the one a blot> ‘oon haban, ‘ frag-
ment of the book‚’ and the other becon eh, ⁸ a
trifle more‚' because they fell so far short of
his own great conceptions. See the description
