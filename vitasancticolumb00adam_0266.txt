Nepos Leathain, iii. 17, iufra, This surname,
in lrish Uo (aueum, is met with in the Calen-
dar at Oct. 213 Ann. Inisfall. 718; and the
Four Masters, 865, where a second Cormac
Ua Liathain is mentioned, who is called in the
parallel entry of the Ann. Ult. (866) lVepos
Liatlnzz'n. The Ul Lmtmn, Nepotes Letlmni,
were a. elan descended, and deriving their
name, from Eoehaidh Liathain, or Liathanach,
a Munster chief, who was sixth in deseent from
Oilill Olum, King of Munster, A.D. 234. Crim-
thann Mor, nephew of this Eochaidh Liathain,
was monarch of Ireland from 366 to 3783 so
that we may consider the middle of the fourth
century as the period at which the latter flou-
rished. In after times, the name of the Ui
Liathain was given to their territory, and the
lordship of it became hereditary in the family
os O'hAnmcadha (Four Mast. 745, 760, 1014}
Cambrens. Evers. vol. i. pp. 273, 277, reprint).
After the English invasion the cantred of
Olehan was granted to Robert Fitz Stephen,
from whom it passed to William de Bai-ry.

About the same period, when dioceses in Ire-
land were partitioned into rural deanries, Ole—
than became the name ofa deanry in the diocese
of Cloyne, and appears on the ancient Taxa-
tion Roll as a district extending over eighteen
parishes‚ the principal of which was Castrum
ΟίείΙιαη, now casile-lyons. In the Regal Visi-
tation of 1615 the decanatus de Casae-lyon
represented the same portion of the diocese.
The territory was situated in the south-east of
the present county of Cork, and is now nearly
represented by the baronies of Barrymore and
Kinnatalloon. According to the pedigrees of
Cor-mac given in the Book of Lecan, he was
son of Dima, son of Coman, son of Qdumaig.
son of CongaL son of Cairbre, son of Sionach,
son of Eochaidh Liathain. The pedigree in
Mac Firbis is incorrect in making Daire Cei-b
his grandfather (Geneal. MS. p. 740 a). On
the name Ua Liathain, see O'Flaherty‚ Ogyg-
iii. 81 (p. 381); O’Donovan, Book of Rights,
p. 7²3 Four Mast. 1579·
