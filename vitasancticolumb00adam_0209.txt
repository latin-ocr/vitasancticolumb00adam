women then went, having with them the son that

To this wild, but very ancient, legend may be
added another early notice of the stream:
“Primo vero venit [S. Patricius] ad vallem
Sescnani et aedificavit ibi aecclesiam primam
et portavit filium Sesceneum nomine episcopum
secum et reliquit ibi .ii. pueros perigrinos.
Vespere vero venit ad hostium Ailbine ad

the ancient name of Dublin. and that by which
it is still known among the lrish-speaking na-
tii-es. The Dinnseanchus says that it was called
the Ford of Hurdles from the bundles of twigs
which the Lageuians, in the reign of their King
Mesgeira, placed across the river Liffey for the
purpose of conveying the sheep of Athirny Ail-
geasaeh to Dun Edair. Sue the interesting

The etymology ot' the name Dublin is

“Civitas Atheliath, quae est in aquilonali La-
ginensium plaga, super fretum maris posita:
et illud Scotice dicitur Dublin, quod sonat La-
tine Nigra Therma.·' (Aet. SS⁴ Jun. i. p. 3¹9⁰³

‘ a hurdle,¹ is allied to the old Welsh cluit, the
Latin clstelloe, and more remotely, to crates
(Anglice crate) and its diminutive craticula,-
closely to the Greek κλῆθρα, and its cognate
clathri‚· and is directly represented by the later
forms, cleda, cleia, cleta, cloea, cloia, which are
to be found in Ducange, in the sense os wicker
or basket work, and have passed into French
in the form claie. See Zeuss‚ Gram. Celt. i.
