(226), or pueri familiares (2 5). Besides the congregation, or collectio (207), ofpro-
fessed members, there were generally present pereqrini (61, 86, 203, 204), who were
sometimes called proselyti (55, 59, 61, 85), or poenitentes (50, 58, 157), or hospites<
(27, 41, 45), whose sojourn was of varied length (61, 158, 204).

The principle of OBEDIENCE is embodied in the precept of Columbanus: “ Ad pri-
mum verbum senioris omnes ad obediendum audientes surgere oportet, quia obedientia
Deo exhibetur, dicente Domino nostro J esu Christo: Qui vos audit mc audit?
and the measure of obedienee is defined to 00 usque ad mortemu. It is rea· mallentin.
eonable to suppose that this essential of monastic order was strictly observed
in the Columbian system. Hence the readiness of thc brethren to prepare 011 the
shortest notice for a long and wearisome journey (60), or a distant and hazardous
voyage (47, 109, 1 1 1, 155), or to do the service of the monastery (106), or to submit
to exposure 111 out-door work, at the local Superior's desire, during the most inc-lenient
weather (57), or to undertake an office of responsibility, though by a nephew’s order
(86). Hence the acquiescence in an injunction to intemiit a custom (217), and the
severe rebuke which attended a violation of his command (218, 226). The obedientia
eine mora of the Benedictine Rule' was evidenced in Hy by the alacrity with which the
abbot’s orders were executed (91 ‚ 112, 125), and the speed with which a distant bro-
ther forsook the church of his sojourn, and hastened, at the abbot's call, to Hy, there
to abide in ‘cera obedientia (60). Obedience, however, had its limit to things lawful:
for Adamnan, when abbot, was unable to effect a change in the observance of Easter.

The members had all things common. Personal property was disclaimed, accord-
ingto the injunction in Columba's heremitica] Rule: lmnoehco oo 511οΓ 00 rechem
