“ S. Donnanus martyr cum multis sociis, ad Britanno-Hibernos profectus missis a Rege
satellitibus, qui eum interficerent, tantisper ad ejus preces expectarent, donec Missam
finiret. Qua finita ipse S. Donnanus cum suis martyrio est coronatus in eodem loco.'’
To this is subj oined a Latin translation of Maguire’s gloss on the Feilire, which has been
given above, with an English version.

Now, as to the date of the tragedy, writers are very much at fault: Sirinus con-
jectures that it was before 596, whereas Keith⁰‚ following DempsterQ refers Donnan's
florebat to so late a year as 840. But the true date is placed beyond any question by
the hitherto unnoticed entn'es in the Im'sh Annals. Tighernach‚ at 617, says, Com>
bustioq Bonnam—Effe 111 [m] xv. Kal. Maii cum CL. nmrtirsbustss and the Annals of
Ulster, at 616, in the same words. According to the peculiam >computation of the
Annals of Innisfallen, the event took place in 611, at which year they record the
Opgcnn Donnmn (350 111 xu. col. mon, ‘ the destruction of Donnain-Ega 011 the 15th
of the Calends of May.' According to the Annais of Ulster, which are more correct in
their notation than the printed textos Tighernach⁵, the first of J anuary, in 617, the
year of Donnan's martyrdom, feu 011 Saturday, so that the Sunday-lettcr of the year is
B, which is also the Regulam-letter of April 17, and thus the saint's death is calculated
to have occurred on Sunday, a fact which we would have been led to expect from the
mention, in the Calendars, of his having been at mass at the time he was attached. 11
is, however, a mista-ke in the Martyrology of Tandacht to say that it was on Easter
Sunday; for that festival, in 617, fell on April 3, and in 618, on April 16, neither of
which, even supposing the latter to be thc truc date, could coincide with St. Donnan's
day. It is a remarkable test of the 00011130)- of the Annals of Ulster to find a year and
a chronological note assigned for an occurrence which 15 limited by a easual expression
in a gloss upon the Calendar; and it is to the credit of that gloss, that what might be
supposed to wear the appearance of a random statement is borne out by the solid testi-
mony of veracious chroniclcs.

I.n process of time, the island again became a religious abode, and the Annals of
Ulster have preserved the obit of onet successor of St. Donnan: 724, Otm princeps [supe
rior] qu mortuus est. The Irish Calendars add some other names, but as their object
