Adamnan's mention of it is only casual‚ and as
an introduction to the main event of the chap-
ter, the angelic manifestation. Had there been
no vision to relate, no fact would have been re-
corded; and thus we have a painful instance
of the secondary importance attached by the
biographer to historical narrative. A word
from him would have t'reed the inquiry of its
difficulty, but to relate an ecclesiastical oecur-

rence for its own sake was foreign to the scope-

of his work.. O'Donnell, in his endeavour to
reduce the irregular anecdotes of Adamnan
into chronological order. places this occurrence
immediately after the departure of St. Columba
from the monastery of Clonard, and styles him
“probus adolescens.”—i. 42 (Tr. Th. p. 395 b).
The present chapter, however, seems to imply
his having now attained to manhood. The
anonymous Life of St. Columba, most probably
compiled by Stephen White, of which Abp.
Ussher published an extract that had been
communicated to him by that learned Irish-
man, represents St. Columha’s conduct in
bringing about the battle of Cul Dreimhne as
the offence which the synod was assembled to
condemn: “ In illo vero tempore, quo haec
fiebant, seniores Hiberniae miserunt per nun-
cios fideles epistolam ad S. Gildam de genere
Saxonum [recle Britonum], ut charitatem mu-
tuam nutrirent. Cumque literas per ordinem
legeret, et epistolam a Columba. scriptam in
manibus teneret, statim illam osculatus est,
dicens : Homo qui scripsit hanc, Spiritu sancto
plenus est: et ait unus de nunciis: Ut dixisti
ita θεῖς sed tamen a synodo Hiberniae repre-
henditur, eo quod cognatos suos in periculo
mortis constitutos belligerare jusserit.'’—Brit.

Eccl. Ant. (Wks. vi. p. 468.) Ussher accord-
ingly places this synod immediately after the
battle of Cul Dreimhne, in the year 561. (lh.
Iud. Chronol.) VVhom Colgan follows (Tr. Th.
p. 450 α, n.43). Messingham, in a marginal
note on the present chapter, suggests, ‘⁴ Ob ee-
lebrationem Paschatis'· (Florileg. p. 17¹ a);
but this is a mis-conception, because, as Dr.
Lauigan observes, “there was no disputo iu
lrelaud about the time os celebrating that fes-
tival until atter his deathly (Ec-cl. Hist. ii. p.
150, n. 138.) O¹Donnell‚ to save his patron's
reputation, thus distorts the present narrative ς
“improborum quorundam hominum invidiam
provocavit, odia conscivit: qui invidi virtutis
ejus falsum, nescio quod, crimen affingunt, affic-
tumque divulgant. Inde secutum, ut loci An-
tistes insontem excommunicatione impeteret.
Fulminata excommunicatio cum Columbae in-
notuit, ad Episcopum coacto tum Clero cu-
mitia celebrantem, convolavit, non magis suae
infamiae, quam multorum scandalo occursurus.

founder of Birr‚ is to be distinguished from
Brendan, son of Finnlogh, the founder of Clon-
fert. They were contemporary, and intimato,
friends of St. Columba. For an account of St.
Brentlan os Birr‚ see cap. 11, infra.
