is said to have commemorated some particulare of his life, and poems ascribed
to Baithene are more than once referred to by O’Donnellm. Metrical com-
positions bearing the name of St. Muran are also cited by the same compilor-⁰,
who adduces them as his authority, in part, for the history of St. Columba's
infancy. Thus furnished with record and tradjtion‚ and quickened, moreover,
with zeal for the honour of a kinsmanp after the flesh, the ninth abbot of Hy
became the biographer of the first, and produced a work, which, though not
ostensibly historicalq, and professing to treat of an individual, is, “ the most
authentic 1011111101·Γ now remaining of several other important particulars of the
sacred and civil history os the Seots and Picts”⁵, and is pronounced by a
writer² not over-given to eulogy to be ‘⁶ the most complete piece of such bio-
graphy that all Europe can boast of, not only at so early a period, but even
through the whole middle ages.” Our author is indeed as free stom the defects
of hagiology as any ancient writer in this department of literature, but it
must ever be subject of regret that he chose an individual instead of a society
as his subject, and reekoned the history of his Church a secondary consideration
to the reputation of his Patron. IfBede had contented himself with being
the biographer of St. Cuthbert, instead of the historian of England, would he
be now par excellence the Venerable P If Adamnan had extended to history
the style and power of description which appear in his tract on the Holy Places,

Euda, and was commemorated on the 19th of
Feb. See notes, p. 318; Colgan, Act. sanct.

¹¹ St. Asara—He was a little junior to St. Co-
lumba, and died circ. ⁶45- His church was
Faffian, now Fahan, 011 the south-west side of
lnishowen. He was not of St. Columba's race,
but his church lay on the side of Loch Swilly
opposite to the territory where that saint was
born. See an article on St. Mur-a in the Ulster
Journal of Archaeology, vol. i. p. 270.

which O'Donnell cites are included in the col-
