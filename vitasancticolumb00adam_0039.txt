Presace. xxiii
saint of Augia Rheni, or Rheinau“‚ had made his way to Germany about
twenty-five years before, and his Life, which was written a short time after his
decease, though existing in Gez-manf, proves the writer to have been an Irish—
man, and acquainted with Irish occurrences, for it contains some sentences in
the Irish language‚ and speaks ofa monk then living in Fore, to whom the
saint had related the visions which he had at Rheinau. And, that it was not
unusual to carry books abroad, appears by the many Irish manuscripts which
are preserved on the Continent, and, especially, from the donations which
Dungar· made to St. Columbanus’s monastery ofBobio, and Bishop Marcusz to
that of St. Gall. The discovery of the manuscript of Adamnan at Rcichenau
by white, and the communication ot' his copy to Ussher, Colgmi, and the
Bollandists, have been already mentioned& then or by whom it was removed
from that monastery is not known, but that it found its way to Selmffhausenh
before the suppression in ¹799 has been shown above. Dr. F erdjnand Keller,
who has the eredit of bringing it to light again, thus writes, Jan. 185 1 : “ The
present proprietor of the MS. of S. Columba is the Town-library (publio
library) of Schaffhausen. Here I found thjs codex in 1845 attho bottom ofa

in Latin, Auyia Rheni. It is situate on a pic-
turesque island of the Rhinc, not far from the
eatan-act beside Schaffhauscn.

¹ Germany.-Published by Goldastus in his
Rerum Alamannia-arum Scriptores, p. 318 (Fran-
cof. 1606). The saint, who was a native of
Leinster, is called Findan in the Life.

Υ Dunqal.—— The catalogue ot'the books which
this Irishman gave to the monastery of Bobio
has been published from an ancient MS. by Mu-
ratori (Antiq. ltal. Dissert.43v tom. iii. col. 821).
The memorandum prefixed to the catalogue
states that they were the books “quos Dun-
galus praeeipuus Scottorum obtulit beatissimo
Columbano,'' that is, to his monastery, for the
founder of Bobio was now 200 years dead. A
manuscript in the Ambrosian Library at Milan,
formerly in the Bobio collection, has these
lines ;

“ Sancte Columba, tibi Scotto tuus incola Dungui

Tradidit huuc Librum, quo Fratrum corda bccntur.''

lb. col. 826. Dungal's catalogue mentions

821 (Mediol. 1740)-

¹ Marcus—In 8⁴1» Marcus, an Irish bisbop,
and his sister's son, Moengal (latinized Mar-
celius), returning from a pilgrimage to Rome,
visited St. Gall⁷ and were induced to make it
in future their home. Marcus bequeathed his
books to the monastery, and Mocngal became
director of the inner school, and toacher of
those boys who wore the cloister dress, and
were, sor the most part, while yet children,
devoted to the monastic lise. See Keller, ut
supra. p. 63.

⁵ Mentioned—See pp. ix., x., sapum Acta
Sanctorum, Junii‚ ii. p. ¹90 α.

b Scltaff'ltausen.—The identity of the MS.
now existing there with that. formerly seen at
Reichenau, is put beyond the shadow ol'a doubt
by two memoranda, on the first page, which,
though partially erased, admit of being read:
one at the top of p. 1, col. a, Liber Auyioe Dt-
vitis; the other at. the foot os the page, Lib·
auyz'e maioris.
