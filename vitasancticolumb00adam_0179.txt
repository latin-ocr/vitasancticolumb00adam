Ἀ Staqnum Cet-Loch Ce in Moy-Lurg, com-
monly called Louyh Key. The name is of fre-
quent occurrence in the Annals and other Irish
authorities. Lough Key is situate north-east
of the town of Boyle, in the northern part of the
county of Roscommon, and covers an area of
2276 acres. ‘⁸ In insula cujusdam lacus in Con-
nacia siti‚”etc.—O'Don. i. 101. (Tr. Th.405 b.)
See ii. 19, infra.

*⁸ Bos diesem—At ii. 19, it is called by the
Irish equivalent Bo. The river, which gives

. its name to the town and barony of Boyle, is

always written in Irish bunt, and latinized
Buellia. A monastery, anciently called Ath-
da-Iaarq, from a ford on the river, became affi-
liated to Mellifont in 1161, and was subse-
quently known by the name of Πῖωηητθῃ nu
hume, ⁴ Monastery of the Boyle! See O'Do—
novan on Four Mast. ¹¹74 The river runs
out of Lough Key and enters the Shaunon a
little north-west of Kilmore, anciently called
cni-mon-Omhpmb, the Cella lilaqna Deatlzrib

O'Roddy, and Colgan, regard the bards or poets
as the representatives, under Christianity, of
the old Pagan mayi or druids of [reland. (vit.
S. Columbae, iii. 2, Tr. Th. p. 430 b; Act. SS
p. 149 b, n. 15.) They were a very influential
class at all times, and from their numbers,
when superadded to the clei-gy, a very oppres-
sive one. From their exorbitant demands
arose the legend of their Com runci, ⁵ Pot of
covetousness,' which was the depository oftheir
gains. They are said to have been in danger,
on three occasions, of expulsion from the king-
dom, and each time to have found in a king
of Ulster a successful advocate of their cause.
Itis stated that one of the objects sought by
King Aedh in holding the convention of Druim-
ceatt was to procure from the chiefs of lreland
a formal sentence of banishment against the
body, but that St. Columba appeared as their
apologist, and procui-ed a compromise of their
suppression in a limitation of their number and
demands. The account of his proceeding is
given in the prefaees to that semi-bardis com-
