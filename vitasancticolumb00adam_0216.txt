English traveller in a condition singularly re-
sembling that of the Book of Armagh, and
adding an interesting illustration of a practice
probably derived from the same school. “ The
books of Abyssinia are bound in the usual way,
sometimes in red leather and sometimes in
wooden boards, which are occasionally elabo-
rately carved in rude and coarse devices: they
are then enclosed in a case, tied up with leather
thongs; to this case is attached a strap, for
the convenience of carrying the. volume over
the shoulders; and by these stt-aps the books
are hung to the wooden pegs, three or four on
a peg‚ or more if the books were small: their
usual size was that of a small, very thick
quarto.''—Curzon's Monasteries of the Levant,
p. 93 (Lond. 1849), where see the interesting
drawing of the library of Souriani. Concerning
the lai-ger leather receptacles for books, see
the note b on the following chapter.

² Hymnorum libem-A volume containing
hymns sor the various services of each day in
the week. We have no collection remaining to
answer the present description ; but there are
abundant materials for an Irish Hymnal pre-
served in the Antiphonary of Bangor, the Lea-
bhar Breac, Mone's Hymni Medii AEvi (Frey-
burg, ι853-4), and, above all, the celebrated
Liber Hymnormn, now preserved in the Library

of Trinity College, Dublin, which Dr. Todd has
undertaken to edit for the Irish Archaeological
and Celtic Society, and of which the first fas-
ciculus has already appeared.

b Pelliceo saccula-Resides the polaire, the
Irish employed, for the carriage of their books,
leather receptacles of larger and rougher con-
struction. These were called Cinga, or‘ satch-
els‚' and were generally carried on the back.
We do not find this term in the Latin lives, but,
instead of it, we meet the word scetlza, which
assumes the various forms of sceta, squesa, and
cetha, and is probably akin to the English word
sheath. The earliest allusion to such recepta-
cles is probably that in the Tripartite Life of
St. Patrick: ‘¹ Dum enim ipse vir Apostolicus
in Romano [de Britannia regressus—Jocelz'n]
itinere constitutus esset, occurrerunt ei in via
sex clerici Hiberni, Romam peregrinationis
causa tendentes totidemque pueri eorum eo-
dices cingulis appensos, gestantes. Hoc vi—
dens vir Dei, ait, ecce vobis pellem quandam,
super qua ego olim in Hibernia discumbere, et
in celebratione missarum annis duodecim stare
consueveram, ex ea facite vobis peram, in qua
libros gestetis.’'—ii. 9. (Tr. Th. p. 130 b.) In
the Life of St. Kiaran we find mention made of
the ¹¹ sarcina cethae quae erat de pelle facta, in
qua evangelium positum erat, [quae] circa pe-
