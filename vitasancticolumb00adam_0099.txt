poem of twenty—two stauzas; and another poemg of serenteen stamas, which he is sup-
posed to have written on the occasion of his fljght stom king Diarmait. Besides these
there is a collection of some fifteen poemS, bearing his name, in one of thc O'Clery
MSS. preserved in the Burgundian Library at Brusselsh. But much the largest colles·-
tion is contained in an oblong manuscript of the Bodleian Library at Oxford, Laud 61 ς’,
which embraces ererything in the shape of oem or fragment that could be called
Columba's, which industry was able to scrapqiogether at the middle of thc sixteenth
century. Many of the poems are ancient, bu inthe whole collection there is probably
not one of Columeine‘s composition& Among them are his alleged prophecics¹‚ tln·

Edward Lhuyd gives a brief statement ot* its con-
tents, and describes the book as ‘⁶ an old Vellum MS,
consisting of 140 pages in the form of a Musick
Book’' (Archaeol. p. 436 c). On n fly-leaf at the
beginning is written, “ Liber Gulielmi Laud Archicpi.
cant. et Canceuar. Universit. Oxou. 1636.·' There
is no record of the scribe who copied the book, but
the writing indicates the date of about ι 550.

Κ Ger-uine omposition.—Among its many coun-
terfeits, it has a poem by St. Brendan of Bior on the
death os columcille (p. 39), which is open to the
somewhat serious objection that St. Brendan died
twenty-four years before St* Col umba!

¹ Alleyed prophecies.-As‚ predictions of the evils
which should fall on Ireland for her crimes (pp. 22,
77, 79, 109). Another in which he predicts, among
other evils, the death of the royal bisbep, Cormac
Mac Cullenan (p. 82). A predictiou of the degeo<
eracy of the bishops of Ireland (p. 1 18). Another,
foreteuing the wretchedness of the Irish kings, and
that foreigners should corne from the east to conquer-
them! (p. 119). A prediction of the desolation ot'
Tam, Ailech, Cruachan, Emhain, and Ailleann

(p. 128). A mouruful prediction of the future de-
generucy os the Irish people (p. 139). See note 2¹,

Lnud MS. at p. 82, and is printed in a corrupt and
mutilated form in O'Kearncy's “Prophecies of St.
Columba‚'‘ pp. 32—60. This may be taken as the
earliest mention of the buri'al of St. Columba in
Down, and one of the authorities sor the disturbance
of his remains by Mandar the Daue (see p. 3¹⁴·
