ἱ>ΛΜοοαεαίῖιιί.--Τ11εῐ clan name by which he
was distinguished, Colman elo niue Ui Semi.
—(Tighernach, 6113 Annal. Ult. 6103 Four
Mast. 610.) He was descended from Eachach,
son of Muiredhaeh‚ whose legendary destruc-
tion by the expansion of the river Banu gave
to that sheet of water the name of koch neue-
ssch, now called Loclz zVeayll. His descendant
in the sixth generation was Clothrach, who had
two sous, each giving name to a sept ; namely,
Fedhlim Sumne, or Salline, the head of the
Dal Sailne, or Dal Selli; and Fedhlim Buan,
the head of the Dal 771-Buain.—-(Mac Firbis,
Geneal. MS. pp. 102, 728 b; Irish Neunius,
p. 268; Dinnseancbus in Book of Lecan, fol.
252 bb.) Every man in the elan Dal-Sailue
was a moe 111 Soilne.

is very frequent. Thus Bede's colmanus (ll.
E. iii. 25, 26) is columbanus in the Annals of
Ulster, 667, 675, and Tighcrnach 676. Colman
Mor of Irish history is Columbanus in Adam-
nan (i. 14). So ii. 15, 16, iii. 12. See Usshor.
Brit. Ec. Ant. c. 17. <Wks. vi. p 536.) Tim
Columbanus is the Colman-Eala or colmanellus
of the Irish calendar, Sept. 26: and the patron
saint os Kilcolmouell on the east of Knapdale
in Argyle, and of Colmonell in Ayrshire. See
the note on the name at ii. 15.

θ Charybdis Brecani.—See the titulus of ii.
13,where Cod. B. adds, ·⁶ iu vortice Brecain.''
Called by the Irish Come bnecmn, ⁶ Brecan‘s
Cauldron.‘ from the peculial· motion of tlu-
water, and the tradition that Brecan son of
Maine [ob. A.D. 440]‚ son of Niall of the Nine
Hostages, was engulfed by it. Although the
name has long since shifted to the strait bv-
tween Scarba and Jura, just as Scotia has sor-
saken its original home, there can be no doubt
that in Adamnan's day this Curry-Brackan
was situate near the Irish coast: its connexion
with the island of Rathlin in the title, and th(-
expression “transnavigare incipiens'¹ in tlw
chapter, are sufficient proofof this. Part of thu
