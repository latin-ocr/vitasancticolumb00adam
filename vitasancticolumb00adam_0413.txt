a little, and speaks of the monastery of Hy “ in quo ipse requiescit corpore'’³. But
ere N otker Balbulusb, in the tenth eentruy, borrowed the expression ubi requiescit, a
change had taken place in the condition of the saint’s romains. In the course of the
eighth century it is probable that 1118 bones were disinterred, and depoffied in a slnine
or shrinesc. And 01100 enshrined, they were not likely to be restored to the earth, be-
cause every passing year would increase the veneration which led to the first exposnre.
Yet we find medjaeval tradition confidently setting forth Downpatrick as his resting-
placed, while an original record of very early date claims for the neighbouring church
of Saul the honour of his interment. We might easily reconcile these two accounts by
supposing a translation from Saul, as soon as it became a subordinate ehnreh. on the
erection of Downpatrick into a bishop’s see. The fragmentary memoirs of St. Patrick
contained in the Book of Armagh were put on record in the eighth centuryss. and the
manuscript itselt' was writtens about the year 807 , by a scribe& whose death took place
in 846. Speaking of the burial of St. Patrick, they add: ‘⁴ Colomb cille Spiritu Sancto
instigante ostendit sepulturam Patriciih ubi est confirmat id est in Sabul Patriciii id est
in aeclesia juxta mare pro undecima ubi est conductio martirum id est ossuum Columb-
cille de. Britannia et conductio omnium Sanctorum Hiberniae in die judieii’'j. This
enigmatical passage seems to owe 118 involved construction to the circumstance of its
having been copied from an earlier authority, in which a portion of the matter eon-
sisted of detached explanations, in the form ot* interlinear glosscS, which the copyist,
on account of the peculial· nature 01” his page, or for some other reason, incorporated
with the text. The following conjectural restoration is proposed, as exhibiting 1110
passage in a more intelligible‚ and possibly more genuine form :—
