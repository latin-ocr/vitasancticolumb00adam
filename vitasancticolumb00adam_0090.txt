Fedhh'midhn, the father of Columba, belonged to the clan⁰ which occupied, and
gave name to, the territory smounding Gartan, and was, moreover, a member of the

reigning familiesp of Ireland and British Dalriada.

EitlmeQ the mother of Columba,

was of Leinster extraetionr, and descended from an illustrious provincial king. Thus
the nobility of two moes was combined in their son, and, no doubt, contributed to the
extended influence which he acquired, when education, piety, and zeal were super-

added to his honoumble antecedents.

He. was baptized by the presbyter Cruitlmeohan⁵³, under the name cohme, to which
the addition of cille, signifying ‘ of the chusch’u, was subsequently made, in reference

septuaqinta septem (H. E. iii. 4), which is followed
by Tighernach. The old Irish Life, and O'Donnell,
refer his birth to 5203 but the Annals of Ulster
give 76 years as his age.

246. This was a common name. The mothers of
Bishop Aedh, of St. Maedoc of Ferus, and of St.
Comgan of Glenn-Uissen, were so called. The Irish
Calendar recor-ds the names of Eithne‚ daughter of
Maine⁷ who was commemorated on the east of the
Boyne: and Eithne, daughter of Dunlaing, who
was patron of Tulach-Ui-Felimidha (Sem-has Naeml·
in Book of Lecan). See also the six examples in the
Index to O'Donovan's Four Masters. Deire-Eithue
was the original name of Cill-mac-Nenain.

¹ Leinster extraction—See her pedigree and fa-
mily history at pp. 8, 163, 164, 246, infra. The
legend of king Aedh mac Ainmireeh's death in the
Book of Lecan (referred to in note ὓ, p. 39, infra),
contains a dialogne between the king and St. Co-
lumba. os which the following is a translation: ‘⁴ O
cleric, said the king, obtain for me from the Lord
that my trophy [i. e. my head or scalp] be not
gained by the Leinstermcn. That is difficult for
me, said Colameiue, because my mother is of them;
and they came to me to Dmrow, and by tasting

urged me to bestow the gift of a sister's son. And
what they requested of me was that their trophies

should not be carried off by a sti-anger king. And
1 promised them that.'' Noe, or Naue as Adamnan
calls it (p. 9), the name of Eithne's grandfather, is
common in Irish records. See An. Ult. 674, 710,
7893 and Rath-Noe, p. 87, infra.

¹² Of the March—Not charchas, for then the
name would be Cotum nu 5-ceull. Bede rightly
derives columcelli “a cella et Columba'‘ (H. E.
v. 9). So O'Donnell, as translated by Colgan,
“additamento hille, quod cellam seu ecclesiam sig-
nificat” (i. 30, Tr. Th. p. 393 b); ⁴⁴ partim ab Ec-
clesia, foelici omine, sortiturus‘⁷ (i. 8, ib. 390 b);
¹¹ pueri solebant prae gaudio, elevatis in ccelum ma-

nell ap. Colgan‚ Act. SS. p. 645 b). In the Leabhar

of his coming from the cell in which he read his

what they used to say among themselves was, Has
