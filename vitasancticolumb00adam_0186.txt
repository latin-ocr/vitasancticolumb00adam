[Lm. 1.

Benedicat te Christus, frater3 hunc solus, 8episcopali ritu, frange panemf:
nunc seimus quod sis episcopus. Quare ⁹hucusque te occultare conatus es,
ut tibi a nobis debita non redderetur veneratiog Ρ Quo audito Sancti verbo,
humilis peregrinus, valde stupefactus, Christum in Sancto veneratus est; et
qui inerant praesentes, nimis admirati, glorificarunt ¹⁰Dominum.

immolationis Christi adsint presbyteri, et si-
mul cum pontifice verbis et manu conficiant.”
(Martene, Antiq. Eccl. Rit. i. 3, 8, tom. i. p.
120.) The Irish Chureh seems to have coin-
cided with the Spanish in its estimate of epis-
copal dignity, and the present narrative comes
with greater weight, being written by one who
not only was a priest himself, but was officially
disqualified for the higher order3 and concern-
iug one who created the precedent by his own
subordinate condition.

¹* Fran-qe panem—We gather from these me-
moirs that the practice of the Irish Church in
the celebration of the Lord's Supper, at this
period, varied in regard to its ministration;
that sometimes the attendant priests selected
one of their number, either as eminent for piety
(as in i. 40), or for station (as in iii. 17), or be-
cause a visiter. as in the present instance.
Sometimes two, or probably more, acted as
concelebrants, “simul verbis et manu confici-
entes‚” in which ease they were wont “simul
dominicum panem frangere :” this as performed
conjointly was, ifwe may so say, “ presbyterali
ritu.'' But when a bishop was present, there
being none of equal rank at hand, he “solus
panem fregit‚¹' and thus the celebration was

⁴⁴ episcopali ritu.'‘ In i. 40, supra, we find the

expression “audiens presbyterum sacra eucha-
ristiae mysteria conficientem‚’² from which we
may infer that the consecration was held to be
effected by the sentence of conseeration3 and
hence it might be supposed that the invitation
‘⁴ panem frangere'' had reference to the distri-
bution of the bread to the communicants, and -
not to the aet of eonsecration. See Morinus,
Sacr. Ordinat. Exerc- viii.; Valesius's note on
Euagrius’s Eccl. Hist. i. ¹3·

ἓ Venenum—It appears from a eomparison
ofcap. 26‚supra‚ and ii. 1, with the present chap-
ter, that under the Columbian discipline the
several orders of bishop, priest, and deacon,
were duly recognised, and that the confer-ring
of Holy Orders was considered the peculiar-
function of the first. The present narrative
contains not only a plain acknowledgment of
the distinctness of bishop and priest, but also
the founder’s express declaration ofthe superior
privilege, rank, and honour, of the bishop. In-
stead of the episcopal office being ignored, or
its proper function being usurped by presbyters
in Hy, “a greater respect,'³ as Innes truly re-
marks, “ was in some manner paid to bishops
in that monastery, aud a greater distinction
made betwixt them and priests in the celebra—
tion of the sacred mysteries, than in other
