Thus also Bede relates os St. Oswald's cross:
“ Nam et usque hodie multi de ipso ligno sa-
crosanctae erucis astulas excidere solent, quas
cum in aquas miserint eisque languentes homi-
nes aut pecudes potaverint sive asperserint
mox sanitati restituuntur.” (H. Ε. iii. 2.) A
like virtue was supposed to reside in Irish ma-
nuscripts :

“Denique vidimus quibusdam a

Hibernia fuerant, et ipsam rasuram aquae im-

vim veneni grassantis, totam inflati corporis
absumsisse ac sedasse tumorem.” (H).- i. ι.)

¹¹ Ard Genumana—Ciam son of Oilioll Olum,
was slain in battle circ. 240? his son Tadhg,
having defeated the Ultonians in the battle of
Crinna, received, in consideration of his ser-
vices, a grant of that part os Bregia extending
from Glasnera near Druim-Inesclann [Drumis-
kin] on the north, to Cnoc Maoildoid by the
river Liffey on the south. His descendants
were called from his father the Cianuchta, and
this territory, being occupied by them, was called
the cnloco ce‘o Ciunuocn, or ¹ cantred of
Ciauacht.⁷ Another branch of the family pro-
ceeded northward, and obtained a settlement in
the present county ofLondonderry, to which also
the clau name of Cianacht was given, and which

5tinne gemini, now known as the barony of
Keenaght. This grant seems to have resulted
from the success of 'radhg at the battle ofCar-
ric-Eolairg in the same territory (Tiylz. 248).
But the chief region ofthe tribe was emmam
bne& ⁴ Cianacht of Bregia‚‘ whose limits were
those above mentioned. Daimhliacc [Duleek]
in Meath was in the centre of it. Another
name was that in the text, Ono emuncto,
Altitudo Cianachtorum, of which we find ex-
amples in Tighernach at 248, 662, 688, 736,

742, 748, 749, and in the parallel places of the
other Annals. The Four Masters, at 868, de-

scribe Druim-caradh‚ now Drumcar, as situate
in Ard Cianachta. The inhabitants of the
north portion of the territory were called Ῐ-ἰῐὶ
(Inoa cionaecu, Viri Altitudinis Cianachto-
rum, or, more concisely, Ῐ-ἠῚ Upon, which is
still preserved in Ferrard, the name of the
southern barony of Louth‚ and a Viscountcy in
the Irish Peerage. On the name Cianachta,
see Keating, Hist. (req. Feargus); 0’F1aherty,
Ogygia, pp. 328, 332; O'Donovan, Book of
Rights‚ p. 186; Colgan, Tr. Th. p. 177 b,
n. 90.

³ Supra memoratam partem—Thu is, the por-
tion οἲ Ard Cianachta lying between the Ail-
biue and Ath-cliath‚ afterwards known as
Fingall. This shows that Ard Cianachta ex-
tended southwards to the Liffey.
