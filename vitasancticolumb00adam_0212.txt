fies ‘a stony place.‘ is of such frequent occur-
rence, that among the townland names in Ire-
laud there are no less than forty-fire instances
of Cloqher, and forty-two of the same word in
composition. The nucleus of the settlement
mentioned in the text was the earthen fort in
the episcopal demesne, which was anciently
called Rath-mor BIaiylze-Leamhna, and was
said to have been constructed in the beginning
of the second century by Baine, wife of King
Tuathal 'seachtmar (Four Mast. 111; O‘Fla-
herty, Ogygia, p. 303). lt afterwards became
the seat of the kings of Airghialla, and when
St. Maccarthen founded the see of Clogher in
this place, it was in eompliance with the in-
structions ot* St. Patrick: ¹¹ Vade in pace fili,
et monasterium tibi construe in platea ante
regalem sedem U1·gallensium.” (Colg. Act. SS.
p. 738 b, c. 7.) Hence it was that this church,
being grafted on the lordship, aequired prece-
dence in the dominions of Airghialla, so that
in after ages episcopus Eryalliae became a
common designation of the bishops of Clogher.
The filii Daimeni, from whom the place took
its distinctive name, were sons of Damhin, son
of Cairbre Damhairgid, King of Airghialla,
and were called the Clann Damhin (Ogyg.
p. 365); whose descendants retained the name,
and were represented in 1353 by the family of
Duibthire, now Dwyer (Camhrens. Evers. vol.

i. p. 246 reprint). Mugania was 1115οη Οοιῐὴιη,
*daughter of Damhin.' The following table

There was also a Clanu, or Cinel—Fiaclz, de-
rived from TuathaL son of Niali, who were
settled near Clogher. “ Daimhin orech-argaid
[silver sace]‚ i. e. Tuathalan of the North, had
seven sons in Feara. Leamhna, and it is they
who are called the Sil Tuatlzail at Clochar-
mac—Daimhin. Others say that these sons who
are about Cloehar were not the sons of Tuathal,
but of Daimhin Drech-airgid. This, however,
is not correct, for they were sons to Tuathal of
the North, and this Tuathal was called Daim-
hin.''—Mac Firbis, Geneal. MS. p. 1⁶9· The
name Damhin is the diminutive of Damh, ⁸ bos‚'
