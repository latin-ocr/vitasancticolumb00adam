Vita Sancti Columbae

immoderate profluebat.

Quo propius accito, Sanctus ambas ⁵ipsius nares
binis manus dexterae digitulis constringens benedixit.

Ex qua hora bene-

dictionis, nunquam sanguis de naso ejus usque ad extremum distillavit diem‘.

small square slab having a Greek cross in-
cised. Attached to this space, on the north,
are the remains of some conventual buildings.
North orthem, at a little distance, is the ora-
tory, a small roofless biiilding, formed of slates
without mortar, having the door in the west,
and a small, doubly-splayed window in the east.
Α little north-east. of this is a very curious
building‚ with rounded corners, and one en-
trance in the middle of the north side, without
any traces of windows. Further off from the
oratory, on higher ground to the east, is a
small building, divided into two compartments‚
the southern one of which is nearly semicircu-
lar, having a platsorm of masonry, in the eentre
of which is acircular sunuel, giving one the idea
of a kiln. On the face of the slope south of the
cemetery is a little carn, like a rude altar, and,
beside it, a small square slab with a cross in-
cised. The writer visited the island on the
22nd of July, 1852, in company with his friends,
Cosmo lunes and william F. Skene, the former

of whom has since most truly stated concerning ⁷

these remains, ‘¹ The crowd of low buildings
has all the appearance of a monastic establish-
ment; and, if it was so, these are perhaps the
oldest vestiges of the sort now standing in
Scotland'’ (Orig. Paroch. ii. pt. 1, p. 277); of

course always excepting the monastic group
on Loch Columkille in Skye. Mr. Muir of
Leith adds: “ Eilean Naomh has the enviable
reputation of being closely connected by com-
mon tradition with St Columba, who is said to
have often visited and resided on the island
while prosecuting his missionary labours.''—.
Ecclesiological Notes, p. 59 (Edinb. 1855).
Eilean Naomh, both in the case of this island,
and of that on the north-west of Islay, is evi-
dently a secondary name. Query, is this Hinba?

f Distillavit diem—This, and the first part
of the following chapter, which come here in
the natural order under the head of virtutum
miracula, are transferred in the manuscripts of
the shorter recension to the Third Book (cap. 5),
although that book purports to treat de An-
yelicis Apparitionibus.

³· sociales-The MSS. of the shorter recen-
sion read scotiales, upon which Messingham
gives the marginal gloss Hybcrniales (Florileg.

¹p. 173 a).

¹³ Sala—The latter portion of this chapter
refers to Ireland, and if the former also, the
Blackwater in the county of Meam, anciently
called the sale (as in rom-th Life of stPa.
trick, c. 51, Tr. Th. p. 4² a), or Sele, may be
intended, although St. Patrick denounced it,
