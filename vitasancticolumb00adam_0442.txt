tion or disregard of the episcopal office; for there were at all times bishops connected

like manner the famous Fergil, or Virgilius, ‘the
Geometer,‘ who, from being abbot of Aghabo in Ire-
land, was appointed by Pepin, king of the Franks, to
the monastic see of Saltzburg in Ravana, entered
on the abbatial duties, but “dissimulata ordinatione

to the Annals of Ulster, in 788.

e ily-Five bishops of Hy are mentioned in the
Irish Annals· at various dates. See chronicon
Hyense, in note O, infra, Anu. 622, 7¹2= 966, 968,
978, 987. Innes conjectures that the subscription
Episcopus Myensz's to the acts of the council of
Calcuith in 787 is a mistake for Hyensz‘s.—Civ.
Eccl. Hist. p. 186.

Scoric Church, it was not unusual. Notker Balbu-
lus, unacquainted alike with the geography aud
history of Ireland, says: “In Scotia insula Hiber-

lumba’s displeasure fell, not on the officiating bishop,
but on the presiding abbot. See p. 70, supra.

k Uniras Fratrum—¹⁵ Ordination‚ which among
us is conferred by bishops only, is required by those
who administer the word and saci-ameum, to give
authority for all church transactions. Our episeo-
pacy gives to the individual who holds it no title to
a share in the government of the Brethren's Church,
or of any individua] congregation. A bishop has
no diocese committed to his jurisdiction. Abishop,
like every other servant of the Unity, must receive
a special appointment to any office which he holds,
from the synod, &a Ordinations to the different
Church-‹legrees can be performed only by virtue of
an express commission from the above-mentioned
authorities. The consecration of bishops is gener-
ally arranged by the Synods.”—Resu1ts of the
Synod held at Hermhut, 1848, pp. 149, 150 (Lond.
1849). The expression Charch-deyrees reminds one
of the Irish gradus ecclesiastici.
