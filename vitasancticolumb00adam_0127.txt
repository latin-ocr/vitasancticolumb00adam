the period of St. Columba's visit to Clonmac- batus‚” stood up and roused the dormant prc-
nois that Columbanus, by his advocacy of the judices of some present, so as to cause an

Irish rule at Luxeu in Burgundy, was beginning
to draw down upon himself the displeasure of
the neighbouring bishops‚ in reference to which
he addressed some letters to Popes Gregory I.
and Boniface IV. (Fleming, Collectan. pp.
110, 1¹3= 157.) The Roman missionaries who
visited Britain in 597 brought the merite of the
rival systems under more immediate consider-
ation, and as they were commissioned to ex-
ercise pastoral superintendence over the “ Scots
who inhabited Ireland,'’ a remonstrance froin
the newly founded See of Canterbury, about
605 (Bede's Η. Ε. ii. 4), seems to have had
weight with a portion of the Irish Chureh, and
a bishop called Terenanus was induced to adopt,
and become a zealous advocate of, the reformed
rule. (Vit. S. Laurent. ap. Ussher‚ Wks. iv.
p. 4²²-) The question soon began to assume
the form of a national controversy3 and to give
weight to the Roman side of it, Honorius 1.,
about 630, sent a letter to Ireland urging upon
the opposite party the consideration of their iso-
lated position. (Bede, H. E. ii. 19.) At the same
time Cummian appeared iu a synod which was
held at Campus Lene, or Magh-Lena, near the
modern TuUamore, in the beart of Ireland, where
he pleaded for uniformity with such effect that
the assembly was on the point of pronouncing
a favourable decision, when an individual ofthe
company, whom he styles ¹⁶ quidam paries deal-

adjournment of the proceedings. (Ussh. Syll.
xi.) Shortly after, another conserence was held
at Campus Albus, near Carlow, where the en-
deavours of Laisrean, Abbot of Leighlin, uei-i·
overruled by the influence of Munna (thc Fin-
tenus ofi. 2 sulm). (Vit, S. Munnae, c. 25, Cod.
Marsh, fol. 129 α ας Ussh. Wks. iv. p. 342· vi.
p. 505.) By this time the inhabitants of tho„-
island had separated into two geographia-ai
parties, astet· the old civil division of the conii>
try into the Northern and Southcrn Halves:
sor Bede, in reference to an occurrence of 634,
writes, that while ihe ¹‘ septentrionalis Scotto-
rum provincia'' still adhered to the old practice.
the “gentes Scottorum, quae in australibus
Hiberniae partibus morabantur. jamjudum, ad
admonitionem apostolicae sedis antistitis, pascha
canonico ritu observare didice1·unt.'‘ (H. E.
iii. 3.) This distinction we find practically re-
cognised in the superscription osa letter sent
from Rome in 640, which is addresscd to eleven
ecclesiastics, who are proved by Irish records
to have belonged to the northern division of the
island. (Bede, H. Ε. ii. 19.) whatever effect
this appeal may have had, it is certain that the
Columbian monasteries continued steadfast in
their profession, and from time to time gave
evidence of their firmness by the character of
the bishops whom they sent to Lindisfarne:
Aidan in 634; Finan in ⁶523 and Colman in
