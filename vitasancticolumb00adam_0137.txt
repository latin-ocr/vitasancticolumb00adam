³ Domnallusfilius Aido---Ainmire= his grand-
father, was St⁴ Columba's first cousin. Con-
cerning his father, see next chapter. Aido,
properly Gebo, is the old genitive ot' (les), like
Ferquso in Praef. ii. (p. 8 supr.), and i. 43. 49.

reign of Ireland when the famous convention
was held here. Colgan and 0’Flaherty, sol-
lowed by Chalmers and others, have assigned
590 as its date. The Annals of Clonmacnoise
notice it at 587 ς but the Annals of Ulster place
it at 574: Magna mopomi .i. conventio Droma-
cheta‚ in qua erant Caluini-cille ocur nino (urz-
nnpench [et filius Annuit-ei} This date is
confirmed by a poem cited in the presure to the
Audita—MS* Trin. Coll. Dub. H. 2. 16 (p.680).
Fordun blunderingly calls the place “Insula
Dorcete.” (Scotichr. iii. 41.) The precise spot
where the assembly was held is the long mound
in Roe Park, near Newtownlimavaddy‚ called
the Mullayh, and sometimes Daisy Hill. (Oi-d.
Survey, Londonderry, s. 9.) The memory of
the event has totally perished in the neigh-
bourhood, but in 1645 it was vividly pre-
served, for Colgan‚ writing at that date, says:

“Druimchead est locus Dioecosis et Comita-

per venerabilis, maxime ob multas peregrina-
tiones et publicam Theophoriam, quae in festo
omnium sanctorum in praedietae synodi memo-
riam ibidem celebratae in eo quotannis fit, cum
summo omnium vicinarum partium accursu.”—
Act. SS. p. 204 b, n. 13. The convention was
held in this neighbourhood, partly sor the con-
venience of King Aedan, but more especially
because this was the patrimonial territory of
the Irish monarch. Sce note ⁰, pi 32 supra.

⁰ Superstes erit..-Conall Cu, his eldest bro-
ther. surnamed Cloyzzclz or ‘ Delirious,‘ who op-
posed St. Columb at Druimceatt, was defeated
by Colman Rimidh at the battle of Sleanihain
[Slewin] near Mullingar, in 602, and died in
604. Cunmscach, his second brother. was
slain by Brandubh at Dun Bucat [Dunboyke]‚
in Wieklow, in 597. Maelcobha, the third,
suceeeded to the throne in 612, and, aster three
years* enjoyment ofit, was slain at the battle ot* ⁸
Belgadin or Sliabh-Truim [now Bessy Bell] in
Tyrone, by Suibhne Meann, who held the sove-
reignty till 628, when he was slain. and Domh-
nalL mentioned in the text, became monarch ot‘
lreland.

d Famosus.—He won the battle of Dun-
Ceithern in 629 (see chap. 49 infra), and the
more important one of Magh Rath in 637. See
note on Bellum Roth, iii. 5 infra.
