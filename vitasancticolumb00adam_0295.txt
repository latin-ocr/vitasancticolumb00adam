present day regard a bishop whose patent or
rescript emanated from Donnybrook or Balli-
nasloe instead of Westminster or the Vatican?
Taillte is now called Telamon, which is formed
from Ccnszeunn, the genitive case ofthe word,
agreeably to a common process in anglicizing
lrish names. We find esti Cuilcessnn in Mar.
Gorman, May 18, and ceooh Colltcenn in the
Calendar ofDonegal at the same day. In the old
Taxations of the diocese of Meath, Kilealeyn is
the form in which the name appears. Teltown is
a. small parish adjoining Kells on the south-east,
and possesses not only a cemetery and the ruins
ofan old chureh, but the remains of a large rath
and other ancient works (Ord. Survey, s. 17).
On the origin of the name, and the ancient im-
portanee of the place, see Keating’s Hist. (vol.
i. pp. 192, 210y ed. Haliday); O’Flaherty, Ogyg.
iii. 13, 56 (pp. 177, 304); Four Masters, An.
Mund. 3370, and Dr. O’Donovan’s note (vol. i.
p. 22). Colgan, misled by an incon-eet copy
ofCod. A„ reads Hiseilte, which he proposes
to change (a favourite process with him) to
Genihie, that he may bring the word round to
Geisille, the old name of Geashill in the King's
County (Tr. Th. pp. 364 b, 385 b, n. 4). The
Bollandist editor follows Colgan, and adds, on
his own responsibility‚ the Latin preposition, to
govern Hiseilte in the ablative ease.

³ Finnz'onem.—Cummian, from whom this
anecdota appears to be borrowed, calls him
Finnianus, and identifies him with the indivi-
dual whom Adamnan calls Findbarrus in ii. ι

(p. 103) supra. St. Columba, as has been ob-
served in the note on that place, had two
teachers called Finnian, and the authorities
there cited refer the event related in that pas-
sage to the Finnian of Magn-bile, to whom also
the present narrative would seem referable.
ln support of this choice, it may be observed
that Adamnan in both places calls Finnian
hisham and that while Finnian of Magh-bilo
is generally aeknowledged to have been of this
order, Finnian of Clonard is nowhere, either in
his Life or the Calendars, so deffignated, and
the only place where he is called a bishop is in
the Life of St. Columba of Tirdaglas (Colg.
Act. SS. p. 404 α). On the other hand, there
is no reference to st. Columba in the published
Lives of the former Finnian, with whom tradi-
tion describes him as being engaged in a se-
rious dispute (p. 104, supra), while the Life of
St, Finnian of Clonard not only numbers St.
Columba among his disciples, but refers to the
present interview in the following words :
“ Quodam tempore S. Finnianus intuens suum
discipulum Columbam Kille venientem ad se,
ait uni de suis Monachis; Vide comitem iti-

neris Columbae. Et respondit ille3 video An·-

gelos Dei in comitatu ejus. Et ait Finnianus‚
vere qui adhaeret Deo, unus spiritus est cum
eo.'’—c. 30 (Colgan, Act. SS. p. 397 α).

b Maqistrum.-St. Finnian of Clonard is com-
memorated in the Calendar at Dec. 12, where
Mar. Gorman, and after him O'Clery, style
