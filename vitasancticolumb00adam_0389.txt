ΤἩΕ expression czgjzcs monasteria, as applied to St. Columba, is not limited to the
churches which were founded by him in person, but includes all those which, down to
the writer's time, were established by Columbian monks, or professcd subjection to the
mother church of Hy. Hence it is likely that many monasten'es, which in the seventh
and eighth cent-mes might be classed under the above title, ceased in after times to bear
any traee of their original relation, and became distinguished only by the names of the
immediate founders, under whose patronage they were built. St. Dochonna's chureh,
for instance, was probably at first subject to Hy, though afterwards independent, when
known as St. Machar's of Aberdeen. The following catalogue of Columbian founda-
tions in Sootland admits of considerable enlargement, but it is sufficient to show how
widely the veneration of St. Columba was extended in his adopted country :—

1. &nomn—In the island of Tiree. The modern name is of Scandinavian origin,
but there can be little doubt that it represents the Campue Lunqe so frequently men-
tioned by Adamnan. See p. 59, supra. It has been shown at pp. 48, 207, mpra, that
the names of several Irish saints are associated with places in the island, although the
chief founder has no longer any local commemoration therein.

2. EmcnxAVE.—One of the Garveloeh group of islands. See p. 327, supra. A
modern writer says: ‘¹ The Garvellooh, or Holy Islands‚ are remarkable for having been
