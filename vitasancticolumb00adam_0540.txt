the sovereignty was enjoyed for so long a period by the family whose settlements lay
next Ireland, one would naturally conclude that the nucleus of the colony was origi-
nally planted there, and that the accession of territory northwards was the result of
subsequent increase in population, rather than the original occupation of the chiefs,
whose names the several districts afterwards came to bear. Cantyref and Knapdale
seem to have been the cradle of the race (377), and though Lorne bears the name of
the first ruler after the emigration, it seems to have received it in after times rather
from his descendants than himself, the Genus Loarm‘, who extended themselves in 3.
uortherly direction when the settlements of the ruling family became too narr-ow for
all. The Irish tract says that six sons of Earc removed to Britain: Loarn Mor and
Loarn Beg, Mac Nisi Mor and Mac N isi Beg, Pergus Mor and Fergus Beg; adding, in
reference to Aongus, who remained behind, czgjua tamen semen in Albania est. Now
these duplicate names are partly a device to multiply the number and make it square
with other statements. Besides, Mac Nisi was not peculias to any one, it was a family
title derived, according to the custom of the day, from their mother, whose name was
Nisi, and Fergus Mor is as often called Mac Nisi as he is Mac Eirc. The pedigrees of
the race recognise only five sons whose posterity became known 111 Britain, namely,
Loarn Mor, Aongus Mor, Aongus Beg, Fergus Beg, and Pergus Mor3 of these, the first,
fourth, and fifth became the most distinguished, and founded what the 111511 tract calls
‘¹ the I'lzree Pon-erfida ofDalriadcz, namely, the Cinel Gabhrain‚ 011101 Aengusa, 31111
Cinel Loairn Mor.” Loarn Mor was the founder of the CmeL Lompn, or Genua
Loerni,· Aongus Beg was the founder of the 011101 (1011511Γ11, Genus AEnqusii, who
settled in Islay 3 and the family of Fergus Mor separated in his two grandsonS, Com-
gall and Gabhran, into the two house of 011101 Con'ngmu, Genus Communi, who gave
name to Cowal, and CmeL δοῦῃοιη, Genus Gabbrani, who retained the original set-
tlement in Cantyre and Knapdale. Fergus Mor was succeeded by his son Domhangart,
who was married to a daughter of Brian, a descendant of Eochaidh Muighmeadhoin, who
was sovereign of Ireland from 358 to 365. Their sons were Comghall and Gabhran,
already mentioned. Comghall’s son was Conall, the sixth king of British Dalriada, the
conallus rea-filius Comyz'll of Adamnan (3 z); and in his reign the monastery of Hy was
founded. Here arises the old question (151), Who granted that island to St. Columba ?
Bede says: “ Venit autem Brittaniam Columba, regnante Pictis Bridio filio Meilochon,
rege potentissimO, nono anno regni erS, gentemque illam verbo et exemplo ad fidem
Christi convertit: unde et praesatam insulam ab eis in possessionem monasterii faciendi
aeeepiff’e. And, in the preceding chapter: “ Quae videficet insula ad jus quidem Brit-
