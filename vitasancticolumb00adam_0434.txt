Institutio Hyenais,

Sr. Cotmrs history belongs to the period of the Irish Church when the Secundus
Ordo of saints prevassed, and his name, with those of the Brendans, Comgall‚ and
Cainnech, whom Adamnan records with honour as his special ffiends, appears in the
catalogue os its worthjes. This Order may be regarded as the development of a native
ministr-y, whose system possessed more nationality than that of their predecessore, and
took a deeper impress firom the customs and condition of the country. Its characteris-
tics were: “ Pauci episcopi, et multi presbyteri3 diversas missas celebrabant, et di-
tersas regulas3 unum Pascha XIV. Luna3 unam tonsuram ab aure ad aurem; abnega-
bant mulierum administrationem, separantes eas a monastefiis’'⁸. The diversity of
liturgica] practice probably arose from the mixed character of the Primus Ordo, which
was composed of Romans, Franes, Britons, and Egyptians ; and their conventual disci-

with great carnage around him) This was proba-
bly the result of the expedition recorded in the Col-
bert Chronicle of lnnes: “ Cujus [Constantini]
tertio anno Normanni praedaverunt Duncalden om-
nemque Albaniam.”

¹¹ onim-The Four Masters briefly say: *⁸ Oitir
and the Foreigners went from Loch Dachaech to
Alba3 and Constantine, the son of Aedh, gave them
battle, and Oitir was siaiu, together with the Fo-
reigners who accompanied him.” Loch Dachaech
was an old name for waterford Harbour.

³ Monasteriis.—The catalogue of the three orders
of Irish saints forms the groundwork of the latter
part of Ussher's Brit. Ecel. Antiqq. It was first
printed by him, aud the various readings in his
notes show that he had more than one copy ; but he
does not tell whence he derived them (Wks vol. vi.
p. 477). A similar retorti, differing in no material
point except the omission ot* some nameS, was

printed in Fleming's Collectanea, where it is stated
that the recita} was “verba pervetusti et fidelis au-
thoris n‘tae S. Patricii 3³¹ and further, “ quae totidem
fere verbis, regum tamen et Sanctorum praetermissis
vocabulis, leguntur in antiqua et fideli S. Finniani
vita, quae cum aliis plurium Sanctorum Hiberniae
Legendis, quas R. P. Franciscus Matthaeus, nunc
Conegii nostri Girsu-dianus, set nuper provincialis
Minister nostrae Provinciae, circa annum 1626,

lam quae Omnium sanctorum dicitur pertinet) trau-
sumi curavit.''—-p. 43¹ a. Both catalog-nes are
printed, with observatione, in the second volume of

O'Conor’s Rer. ΗΠ). Script. pp. 1 62-165. A eata-
logue, agreeing in the main with Ussher‘s, comes after
