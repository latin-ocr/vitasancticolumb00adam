dykes'' (in'. 2 58). At the end of this is the spot called Kill ma qhoblzanain. Graham
calls this embankment‚ tlae Bz‘skop’s Walk (Iona, p. 4).

2. Onoc-nwuffinyd, commonly called Szsstlzean Mar, or ⁴ Great Pauly-mount& This
is Adamnan’s Colliczdzw Anqelorum (175, z 18). It is a smooth⁷ green knoll, about 167
paces in circumference at the base. Pennant says of it: “ On the right hand, on a
small hill, a small circle of stones, and a little carru inthe middle, evidently drm'dseal,
but called the hill of the anyds, onoc-nan-ainqeal; from a tradition that the holy man
had there a conference with those celestial beings soon after his arrival. Bishop Pocock
informed me that the native-s were accustomed to bring their horses to this circle at the
feast of St. Michael, and to course round it'’ (iii p. 258).

3. Port-an- Churm'clz derives its name from a long, low mound, mnning across the
bay, near high-water mark. It has long been an object of curiosity to travellers.
Martin says of it :—“ ζΓ he Dock Which was dug out ot' Port C'lzztrc'clz, is on the 511031*1 to
preserve Columbus's Boat called Curt'clz'’ (p. 263). A writer of 1701 observes z——‘·' This
harbour is called Port-a-clzurrz'ch, from the ship that Calimkill and his associats came
upon from Ireland to that place. The length of the curuchan or ship is obvious to
any one who goes to the place, it being marked up att the head of the hai-bour upon
the grass, between two little pillars of stons, set up to show forth 5⁰ samam, between
which pfflars there is three score of foots in length, which was the exact length of the
curachan or shjp’' (Now Stat. Acct. vol. vii. pt. z, p. 316). This bay is exposed to
the western swell of the Atlantic, aud is very dangerous except in fine weather (ib.)

4. Opposite the centre of Mmtyr’s Βα)Ὗ is a mound called by the nativos Eala, ‘ the
swan’ (Graham, p. 3); why, they cannot teu. But the truth is, that they are misled by
the sound, for the word really is eoLocpom, ‘ a eoffin’t, and so applied because funeral
parties on landing were formerly in the habit ot* laying the remains upon this mound,
while they thrice performed a deisiol, or right-wisc circuit, round the spot.

5. Τ orr Abb, a rocky eminence opposite the west entrance of the CathedraL outside
the enclosure. “To the west of the convent is the abbot‘s mount, overlooking the
whole'' (Pennant, iji p. 258). This must be the site of what Man-tin describes, when,
speaking of St. Martin’s Cross, he says :—“ At a little further distance is Dan Nc* Mm-
iel», i. e. Mnks-Fort, built of Stone and Lime, in form of a Bastion‚ pretty high.

⁵ &immuunt—From Ῐηῖ), or Γῑό, ‘a fairy.'
Colgan, writing on the Irish term Fir-Sidhe, or
⁶ fairy,’ says ;-“ Vin· Sidhe ab Hibernis spiritus
phantastici vocantur, ex eo quod ex amoenis colli-
bus, quasi prodire conspiciantur ad homines infest-
andos : et hinc vulg-us credat eos quasi iu quibusdam
subterraneis habitaculis intra istos colles habitare,
haec autem habitacula. et aliquando colles ab Hiber-

nis Sidhe vel Siodha vocantur.”—Tr. Th. p. 32 a,
n. 493 Act. SS. p. 56 b, n. 6. See Reeves's Eccl.
Antiq. under Rath-sith, p. 68.

ῑ Coffin.—The Irish word eotucporn, ‘a bien-‚⁵
is possibly from the Latin feretrum. At Port-na-
marbh, the mortal remains of those who are conveyed
sor intermeat to Hy, are brought ashore, and are de-
posited on the mound (Ul. Jour. Arch. i. p. 80).
