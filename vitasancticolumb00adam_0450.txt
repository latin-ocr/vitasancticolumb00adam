formed at the canonica] hours; for, although Adamnan is silent 011 the subject, the
Life of St. Cainnech mentions a ease in which iVone was observed in Hym, and it is
not likely that the Columbian usage would have differed from the general
monastic practice of the age. The brethren who were employed 011 the
farm were not required to attend during the day¹¹ (71), and fatigue after
their labom· would probably demand unbroken sleep at night. The congregation was
summoned to the orator-y sz'yno personante (170, 213), that 15, by the sound of the beu
( 3 3, 234), both on stated and extraordinary occasions. Being assembled, they pro-
ceeded to the oratory, sometimes in attendance on the abbot (21 1), sometimes with less
regularity (34, 234). At night they carried lantems with them (235).

The dz'es solennes were the dies Domum, and Sanctorum natales (181, 182, 210),
which wore solemnized in the same manner, by rest from labour, the celebration of the
Eucharist, and tho use of better food (1 1 1). Τ110 festival commenced after the sunset of
the preceding day (181, 210, 230, 310), and its stated services were the lespertinalis
riez‘ssa (112, 191, 233), Allatutz'm? (234), Prime (209), Tierce, Sext (181), and probably
ivone (90, 121, 156). The chief service, missarum solemnia (77, 210, 221), was some—
times at Pre'me (209), or at Sext (181) ; 011 511011 an occasion the cantores (21 1) chanted
the wonted office, in the course of which there was a commemoration by name of cer-
tain saints (21 1). In the sacra Eucharistiae ministeria (210), also called saera mysteria
(211, 221), saeroe oblationis mysteria (77), or obsequia (210, 211), wine (104), and

the expression matutinae Synaxeos, ILE. iv. 19.

The chapter of the Rule of Columbanus, De Cursu,
prescribes: ¹¹ Per diurnas terni Psalmi horas pro
operum interpositione statuti sunt a Senioribus nos-
tris cum versiculorum augmento intervenientium
pro peccatis primuni nostris, deinde pro omni po-
pulo Christiano, deinde pro Sacerdotibus, et reliquis
Deo consecratis sacrae plebis gradibus, postremo pro
eleemosynas facientibus, postea pro pace regum, no-
vissime pro inimicis.‘'—Cap. 7 (Ἑ10111, Coll. p. 6 α).
The corresponding order of special intercessions in
the Antiphontzrium Bencltorense is as follows: 1.
Oratio communis Fratrum, beginning “Ne memi-
neris iniquitatum nostrarum.” 2. Pro Baptizalis.
3. Pro Abbate. 4. Pro Fraternitate. 5. Pro Pace
populorum et reyum. 5. Pro Blaspliemamibus.
6. Pro Impiis. 7. Pro Iter ,facientibus 8. Pro
Eleem6sinariis. 9. Pro Infit-mis. This serves as
an interesting commentary 011 the Ru1e; aud, cou-

the reference in Senioribus nostris. Possibly Offi-
cialis Liber would be a more suitable name than
Antiphanarium .· it is the title found in a St. Gau
manuscript (Maskell‚ Mon. Rit. Ecel. Angl. vol. i.
p. xxxiv.); and the two classes of Irish service
books were Libri Officiales et Missales (Vit. S-
Munnae, c. 12, Cod. Marsh. 128 aa).
