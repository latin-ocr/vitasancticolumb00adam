After the commission of an offenee, the penitent was required coram omnibus peo-

cantiam suam confiteri (59, 77), generally on his knees (59, 98, 99), and thus, promis-

ing amendment, paenitentiam affere (98). In such ease the abbot either

lwfmtenna. absolved him on the spot (59), or enjoined a more lengthened discipline,

jutta*judicationem (52), which was tei-med the leqes poenitentz'oe (52, 157),

and sometimes extended to an abode of seven years at a prescribed station (157), some-

times even to twelve, occasionally accompanied by sels-mortification, and perpetual

exile from father-landf (52). The penitent who fuhfflcd 1110 injunction salutem exer-

The. Tonsure of the Secundus Ordo, in which 1110 founder was reckoned, was ab aure

ad aurem, that is, the anterior half of the head was made bare, but the occiput was

untouchedg. This usage existed in St. Patrick’s time, who may have found

Pensm-a. it in the country ; it was adopted by St. Columba, and continued in his
Order until 718, when the eoronal tonsure was received by the society of
Hyh. This occurred two years after the Pascha] change ; for, though Bede refers the

joint reformation 10 716, 1110 practica] adoption of a new style of tonsure would require
a longer prepzuutionfthan a mere ritual observance. The Greek tonsure was total&
and was style-d St. Paal’s, and the Roman, which was coronal, was styled St. Peter's,
but the 111511 fashion, in order to its being brought into disrepute, was *opprobriously
ascribed to Simon illafflctw and when Ceolfrid cast 11115 up to Adamnan, the latter,
instead ofrcpudiating the name, is represented as aequiescing in the reproach‚ sorbis apo-
logy was etsi Silicenis tonsuram cnr consuetudine patria habeam¹. Another scandal circu—
lated against it was of its introduction into Ireland by the swine-herdm of Laeghajse,

s Father-land.—Like patria, the old Irish word
is acopon, from acum, pater. St. Columba is
extolled in his Irish Life for abandoning his atharda.

of Durrow has a picture of an ecclesiastic in a plaid
chasuble, giving :³ good representation of this tonsure.

λ Tuast—St. Patrick's charioteer was called To-
tus Calvus, in the Book of Armagh, which name is
glossed memmei (fol. 13 bb), and elsewhere is

written Bodmailus (fol. 11 ab). Does the name
indicate any peculiarity of religious origin?

¹ Habeam—Beda Historia Eccles. v. 21.

¹¹¹ Smineherd.—Ussher cites an ancient Cotton
MS, containing a collection of Irish Canens, for the
following: “Romani dicunt tonsuram a Simone
Mago sumpsisse initium, cujus tonsura de aure ad
aurern tantum contingebat ; pro excellentia ipsa ma-
yorum tonsura, qua sola frons anterior regi solebat.
Auctorem autem hujus tonsurae in Hibernia subu]-
cum regis Loigeri filii Nil extitisse, Patricii sermo
testatur: ex quo Hibernenses pene omnes hanc ton-
suram sumpserunt.''— Ec. Br. Ant. c. 17 (Wks.
vol. vi. p. 490). The Irish word for tonsus is
muel, and one of Laeghahe’s Mayi was Lucet-mae]⁷
