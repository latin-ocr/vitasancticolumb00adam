A parish in Lewis, in the modern union of Stornowaw, is called Ey or Y.

The conclusion, therefore, to be come to regarding Iona is, that it is a word which

topographical work, the Dinnseanehusbz—

both are to be pronounced short. Thus Adamnan
latinizes the name Feryna by Ferynouus (iii. 19,

223), showing the equivalence of α, ο, and ou in
such terminations.
