Prqface. xiii

text the chapter but one preceding relates St. Columba’s doing-s in the Campus
Brey, the old name of East Meath, and thus the reference above mentioned is
easy and intelligible. But in the shorter text, where the said passage also
occurs, six of the antecedent chapterS, as given in the longer, are omitted, and
the place which is last mentioned is Skye‚ and further back, for several chap-
ters, the scene is laid in Hy. It is evident‚ therefore, that the true correlative
to supra memorata does not exist in the shorter text, and, as a necessary eonse—
quence‚ that it is mutilated‘. Moreover, as regards the tituli, they form an
integral part of each chapter, for the names which occur in them are often not
repeated, though referred to, in the substance of the chapter, so that their re-
moval. as in the Bollandist edition, from their proper places to the beginning of
the books, that they may not break the thread of the story, illustrates the prin-
ciple upon which they were entirely omitted in the manuscripts3 and ocea-
sionally renders the insertion of some words in the text necessary, in order to
complete the construction. Thus, in i. 49 (92), all the copies have supra me-
morata munitione, but there is no antecedent mention of a munitio except in
the titulus, which speaks De bello in munitione Cethirni, the absence of which
evidently bears witness against the integrity of the shorter text, and, in the
Bollandists, demanded a note of explanation& The very title of Canisius's
manuscript, Incipit prima Prcr’filtio Apula-(linque Adamnani Abbatis sancti serip-
turis, indicates a later hand3 as the ssollandist editor observes‘, “quis enim
seipsum sanctum vocet ?” Accordingly, in giving the preference to the
Reichenau manuscript, he comes to the conclusion that the ‘⁴ KVindbergense
MS. videatur ex hoc desumptum, pluribus rebus taedio forsitan vocum barbari-
carum, vel librarii incuria, 1)raetermissis”¹¹.

Of the seven manuscripts which furnish the various readings in the present
work, three contain the longer, and four the shorter text: these shall now be
considered under the several signatures which are employed to represent
them.
