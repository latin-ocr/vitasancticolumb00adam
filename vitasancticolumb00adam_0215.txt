tary history of Ireland, rises in the north-
west of the county of Kildare, and, enter-
ing the county of Meath, pursues a north-
easterly course, and, widening as it approachcs
Drogheda‚ falls into the sea at Colpe. the an-
cient mbep Cotpcho. It was the southern
limit of Ulster in its largest proportions, and
was also a boundary of Bregia. (O'Donovan,
Ir. Gram. p. 318.) An interesting account of
the river and its neighbourhood, along its en-
tire course, may be seen in Wilde's Beauties of
the Boyne and Blackwater (Dubl. 1850).

ἒ Pelliceo saccula—For convenience and
safety's sake, the service-books, which the
itinerant habits of the early Irish ecclesiastics
required them to carry about from place to
place, were provided with leather cases which
varied in size and execution. They were called
polmne and ringo, which are thus distin-
guished in the ancient Irish Life of St. Co-
lumba: ump bu bef¹ Do runi cpeppo ocor

coc‘oo ‘oo oenum, ‘ for it was his custom to
make crosses,and cases, and salchels for books,
and all church furniturefl The polmne (written
poolme in the Book of Armagh‚ fol. 18 α b) is
explained inan old gloss, mnm oo ce15 hubam,
¹ name for a cover of a book‚' and seems to have
been the ease ofa single book, carefully formed
and embossed. Thus St. Dega, a famous arti-
ficem among other articles of eeclesiastical fur-
niture, is said to have made “librorum cooper-

toria, quaedam horum nuda, quaedam vero alia

cumtecta.”--Acta SS. Aug. tom. iii. p. ⁶59 α.
Ofleather cases the cover of the Book of Ar-
magh is the most interesting example now
remaining. It came, together with its inesti-
mable enclosure, into the writer’s possession
at the end of 1853, and is now lying before him.
It is formed of a single piece of strong leather
36 inches long, and 12 broad, foldcd in such a
way as to form a six-sided case 12 inches long,
ΜΞ broad, and 2} thick, having a flap which
doubles over in front; and is furnished with a
rude lock. and eight staples, admitted through
perforations in the flap, for short iron rods to
enter, and meet at the lock. The whole outer
sursace‚ which has become perfectly black from
age, is covered with figures and interlaeings
of the Irish pattern in relief, which appear to
have been produced by subjecting the leather
in a damp state, before it was folded, to pres-
sure upon a block of the whole size having a
depressed patterm and allowing it to remain
till the impression became indelible. A reduced
drawing of the back, saithfully executed, may
be seen in Petrie's Round Towers, p. 327. But
as this case does not fit the book, which, with-
out the boards, measures only 7} by 5⁴} inches
and is thicker than the receptacle, it is likely
to have been one of a number of impressions
executed from the same block for various ma-
nuscripts. At the upper corners of the sides
are the remains of coarse straps which were
stitched on with leather thongs. These were
for the purpose of slinging the ease from the
shoulder, like a modern postbag. Itis remarka-
ble that all the books in the library of the Abys-
sinian monastery of Souriani, on the Natron
Lakes 111 Egypt, were recently found by an
