Son of Maelduiu, of the race of Conall Gulban. His pedigree is given in the Naemhseanchas,
but it is evidently deficient in some generations, for it makes him twelfth in descent from Conall
Gulbnn, while Adamnau, who died nearly two centuries before, was eighth. Colgan latinizes
his name by Florentius, and states his festival to be April 24 (Tr. Th. p. 481 α, u. 24).

Son ofTornan, of the tace of Couau Gulban, from whom, according to the pedigtee preserved
in the Naemhseanchae, he was thirteenth in descent. He is commemorated in the Calendars of
Mai-ian and of Donegal at Feb. 22, at which day thelatter authority states that the mother of Mael-
brighde was Saerlath, daughter ofCuilebadh, son of Baethghaile. This is copied from the Tract De
Manibus Sanctorum Hiber-nm, commonly attributed to AEngus the Culdee. But the date of that
writer is circ. 800, whereas this, his alleged composition, refers to aman who died in 927. Mael-
brighde was not only abbot of Hy, but of Armagh and Raphoe, and his celebrity must have been
considerable to elicit the follow-ing eulogium from the Four Masters: “ St. Maelbrighde, son of
Toman, coarl) of Patrick, Columeille, and Adamnan‚ head of the piety of all Ireland and of the
greater part of Europe, died in a good old age, on the zznd of February.” He had been elected
abbot of Armagh on the death of Maeleobha, in 888. His penultimam predecessor held the

abbacy of Hy with that of Kildare: this abbot holds it with that of Armagh aud Raphoe3 an
additional evidence of the decleusion of Hy. See Colgau's Acta SS. p. 386.
