Let Aedh Dubh be killed, said all. Not so,
said Derrnaid, but he shall be sent out os Erin,

am alive. Aedh Dubh7 then, was sent into the
country os Alba in banishment by Diarmait,
and 119 was not allowed into Erin after that
during Diarmait's reign* (fol. 809.)

Cepboiu. His father was Fergus Ccrbhall,
500 ofConallCrimthanm and grandson of Niall
of the Nine Hostages. This Diarmait (who is
to be distinguished from Diarmait son of Cerb-
11311, lord ofOssory in 900) succeeded his kins-
man Tuathal Maelgarbh as sovereign of lreland
in 544, and reigned 21 years. He was head of
the Southern Hy Neill, and his descendants
were represented in after ages by the O'Me-
laghlins of Meath. His reign is remarkable in
the civil history of the country as the one in
which Tara ceased to be a regal abode; and,

Ciaran, and his alleged disputes with St. Co-
lumba and St. Ruadhan. His death is thus re-

noll. ⁵ Diarmait. son of Cerbhall, was slain at
Rath-beg in Magh-Line by Aedh Dubh, son of
Suibhne Araidho, King of Uladh : and his head
was convcycd to Cluain [mac nois]‚ and his
body was buried at Connor. To whom suc-
ceeded the two sons of Mac Brea, namely Fer-
gus and Domhnall.' Rathbeg is situate beside
Rathmor, the seat of the Dalaradian lox-ds,

about two miles east of Antrim, and seven
south of Connor. The distance of 010011130-
0015 prevented the removal of his body thither‚
which was interred in St. Macuissi’s chureh of
Connor, the oldest and most important founda-
tion in the neighbourhood ; but his head, being
more portame, was carried to St. Ciaran‘s
chureh of Clonmacnois, which lay in his patri-
mony, and had been the special object of his
bounty. There is a detailed account of the
manner ofDiarmait's death in the ancient Irish
memoir already cited (MS. Trin. Coll. Dub.
Η. 2. 16, p. 809), from which it appears that
he was pop cumpo 11151 *ocimu h-epeno,
‘ upon a royal visitation‚ right-hand-wise, of
Erin' at the time, and that his assassination
occurred in Rathbeg, at the house of 3 chief
called Banban. An extract from the story is
given by Lynch in Cambrensis Eversus (p. 75,
or vol. ii. p. 12 reprint.) See Eccles. Antiqq.
Down and Connor, p. 279.

k Reynatorent—Every province had a regular
succession of kings, and under them were va-
rious degrees of subordinate chiefs, also styled
kings. But superior to all was the King of all
1re1and, who took his title from the regal seat
of Tara, and held about the same relation to
1115 inferiors that the Primate of all Ireland at
present does to the various orders of the
Church. In most respects the supremacy was
more titular than real, and, unless accompa-
nied by personal enterprise‚ was rather a mark
for treason than an engine of government.
Owing to some extraordinary influence the mo-
narchy of Ireland was limited to the 1309 ot'
Niall, until the eleventh century, during all
which period the dignity was ambulatory, with
three or four exceptionS, in the families of Co-
nall Crimthann, head of the Southern Hy Neill,
of Eoghan, head of the Cinel Eoghain‚ and of
Conall Gulban, head of the 01091 Conaill, the
