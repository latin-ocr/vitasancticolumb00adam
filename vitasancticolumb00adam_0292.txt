‘Tribe of Lughaidh, son of Setna‚' or sior
Secno. ‘Raee of Setna,' being so called from
Setua, brother of Fedhlimidh, St. Columha's
father. The churches connected with the his-
tory of St. Columba’s early life are all situated
in this neighbourhood, namely‚ Gartan, where
he was born; Tulach-Dubhglaisse‚ now Tem—

d Glohum {quemn—A ball of fire was seen
over the place where st. Declan was born.
(Colg. Act. SS. p. 601 [reete 511] α.) The mo-
thel· of St. Mochaomhoc left her infant asleep
in her house, and, returning‚ witnessed a pro-
digy similar to that in the text. (II). p. 590 a.)
St. Comgall's mother beheld a pillar of fire
that extended from heaven to the head of her
sleeping infant. (Flem. Collect. p. 304 b.) The
place where st. Brigid lay when 311 infant was
indicated by a similar wonder. (Tr. Th. p.
547 b.) Such portents, however, are not pe-
culiar to hagiology:

*¹ Ecce levis summo de vertice visus Iuli

Fundere lumen apex. tactuque innoxia molli

Lambere flamma comas, et circum tempora pasci.”

AEn. ii. 682.

At a later date, ‘⁴ Puero dormienti, cui Servio
Tullio nornen fuit, caput arsisse ferunt multor-
um in conspectu.” (Liv. i. 39.) The story in the
text is borrowed from Cummian in almost his
very words, with the addition of the presbyter's
name (cap. z).
