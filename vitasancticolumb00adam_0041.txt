Preface.

Triveti super Regsula beati Azcyustini, fol. 79 α to ¹44 b. The leaf measures
9} by 6} inches, and the page 6} by 4} inehes. There are generally 24 lines
to the page. The age of the manuscript has been greatly orerrated. Pinker-
ton, in his Vitae Antiquaed, states it to be Ceut. mii„ and is followed by Dr.
Petrie (215). In his Enquz'rff‚ Pinkerton lowers the date one centiuy, and
describes it as ‘⁶ written in the thirteenth century.”

III. Codex C. The Canisian text, which was published in 1604, “ cx
membranis m. s. Monasterii WVindbergensis in Bauaria.” It seems to be the
manuscript which is mentioned, under the head ll'inclbwy in the Appendix Α1
to the Report of the English Record Commissioners, as S. Adamnanus Scotvs
de S. Columba Scuto.

textg of all the copies ε it is very likely, however, that justice has not been done

In its printed state, this is the most unsatisfactory
to it in the transcription. It belongs to the shorter reeension. In the intro-
duction to the Life, Canisius says : ‘⁶ Notandum est quod codex MS. Rebdoff-
sensis expresse in titulo libri vocat Sanctum 3⁷⁵ and Messinghamh cites him as
his authority for the statement: “Codex MS. Rebdorfensis ubique vocat
Adamnanum, vel Adomnanum.” But this is another name* sor the Wind-
berg MS.. and the town of Rebdorf is situate in the south-east of F ranconia,
a little west of Eiehstndts', ou the north bank of the Altmuhl, a tributary os
the Danube. Canisius's residence and place of publication, Ingolstadff, is not
far off on the south—east.

IV. Codex D. The second tract (fol. 39 αα to 51 ba), in a large vellum
manuscript of the thirteenth century, preserved in Primate Marsh’s Library,
Dublin, vulgarly, though errooeously, called the Book 0 fKilltemzffi, and marked

catos et memorabilium rerum multarum narra-
tionis omissione foedum in modum deformatos.''
