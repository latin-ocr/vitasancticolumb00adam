in the Irish calendar so called. Itis observable
that in eontinental hagiology Columba is a fe-
male appellation3 whereas, among the Irish,
with one or two trifling exceptions, it belongs
to the opposite sex. We have in Adamnan
various Latin forms of the name, as Columba,
Columbanus, Columbus, and Columb. The
first bishop of Dunkeld was Columba, who
flourished about ⁶40-

ἰΒίυίιίαῑ multae..-P1·ov. xxii. 1. The quota—
tion agrees with the Vulgare. Its applicatiou
of nomen is peculiar.

k A diebus insantiae.—This shows that Colum-
ba was an original name. Irish writers pretend
that he was christcned Crimllzann (0100111ὲο1111
‘a fox'), but that his playmates designated
him Columba on account of his gentleness. It
may have been that he had two names, one
baptismal and the other secular‚ as in the case
of Fintan or Munna. Fintan ον Beraeh, Cro·
nan or Mochua, Carthach or Mochuda, Darerca
or Monenna, in the Irish calendar; Munghu
or Kentigern in the Seotch; Cadoe or Cath-
01381 10 the British; Nuallohc or Cuthbert in
the Saxon. It is a curious coincidence that a
distinguished contemporary of our saint was
Columba son of Crimthann. See the first note
on ii. 36, inf

¹Filius repromissionis.—“ Terra “ repromis-
sionisvv is a common name in the lives of Irish
saints for the Holy Land.

“¹ Proplnetatione.—Thirty years, and its mul-

tiples, were the term which the Irish legends
generally allowed sor the fulfilment of such
predictions. St. Patrick prophesied the birth
of S. David and S. Kieran 30 years before (Tr.
Th. p. 208); of S. Comgall, S. Molash, S. Col-
man, S. Mac Nisse, 60 years besorehand (lh.
pp. 88; 209 ὸς Act. SS. Jun. Sep. i, p. 664);
of S. Ciaran and S. Brendan, 120 years in ad-
vance (Tr. Th. pp. 145 ὂ,- 158). The life of
S. Columba in the Cod. Salmant. expressly
limits this prophecy to 60 years. (Tr. Th. p.
325-)

¹¹ Proselytus.—Gr. προσῆλυτος, advena, pere-
yrinus, qui aliunde venit. See the examples of
the term at i. 26, 30, 32, 44 infra.

0 Patricii episcopL—Cummian, in his Paschal
epistle, written circ. 634. calls him ‘⁶ sanctus
Patricius papa noster.¹¹—(Ussher‚ Syll. Ep. xi.)
He is mentioned iu Ven. Bede's Martyrology at
Mar. 17. His Hymn by Seachnall is preserved
in manuscripts of the eighth century. His
Confession 10 the Book of Armagh was tran-
scribed, about the year 800, from his autograph,
then partly illegible; yet Ryves and Ledwich
called his existence in question; and 3 chival-
rous German has lately asserted “ ficta sunt
quae Patricii feruntur scripta. Falsa quae Vitis
traduntur. Incertum est vel Prosperi testimo-
nium.''—-C. G. Schoell, Eccl. Brit. Scotorumque
Hist. Font. p. 77 (Berol. 1851).
