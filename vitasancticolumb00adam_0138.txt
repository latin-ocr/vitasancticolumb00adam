¹DE SCANDLANO FILIO COLMANI.

EODEM tempore Sanctus, et in eodem loco, ad fflcandlanum, filium Col-
mania, apud ³ Aidum regem in vinculis retentumb, visitare eum cupiens, pergit3
ipsumque cum benedixisset, confortans ait: Fili, ⁴¹nolis contristari, sed potius
laetare et confortare: ⁵Aidus enim rex, apud quem vinculatus eS‚ de hoc mundo

land at this period. Of the twelve successions
which took place between the birth of St. Co-
lumba and the reign of this DomhnalL only two
were unattended by violence. His obit, as re-
corded by the Four Masters, is in strict accord-
ance with the biographer's statement: A. C.
639 [recte 642], ¹¹ After Domhnall, son of Aedh,
son of Ainmire, had been 16 years in the sove-
reignty of Ireland‚ he died at Ard-Fothadh, in
T'u· Aedha, after the victory of penance‚ sor he
was a year in his mortal sickness ; and he used
to receive the body of Christ every Sunday.'’
(Vol. i. p. 257. Ed. O'Donov.) The latter part
ofthis entry seems to be borrowed from a pas-
sage in the ancient presace to the Ambra rela—
tive to St. Columba-'s conduct at Druimceatt:
·· The Cleric went then to the assemblage of
Domhnall son of Aedh. And Domhnall rose
immediately before him, and bade him welcome,
and kissed his eheek, and set him down in his
own place. And the Cleric left many blessiugs
on him. viz.‚ to be ten years in the sovereignty
of Ireland; and victory in battle during that
time ; and to fulfll one out ofevery seven ofhis
promises ; to be a year and a halfin the dise-ase
οἷ’ which he should die; and to receive the body
of Christ every Sunday during that time.'’-
(MS. Trin. Coll. Dub. H. ii. 16, p. 681.) The
same passage occurs also in the sequel to the
Irish Life of St. Columba contained in the
Highland Society's MS. fol. 12 α b. The terri-
tory, previously called SereHr, was named from
his father Tit-Aecllza, now Tirhugh, the ex-

treme barony of Donegall on the south-west.
Here, in the parish of Drumhome, and town-
land of Ballymagrorty Irish, is a conical hill,
locally known by the name Rae-oon, the apex of
which is entrenched like a rath, and contains
an ancient cemetery, now used only for the in-
terment of unbaptized children. This is the
“Rath-cunya in campo Sereth‘' of Tirechan.

’ (Lib. Armac. fols. 11 b b, 15 a b.) Beside this

was the regal ahode of Domhnall, as appears
from a statement iu the Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick: “Pergens postea Patricius per Tir-
conalliam, itinere inter Eas-Buaid [hodie Bal-
lyshannon] et Oceanum suscepto, venit ad lo-
cum cui vocabulum Rath-cunya .· ibique a
fundamentis Ecclesiam excitavit . . . . ln
colle vicino Arii-sothadlt appellato, coepit etiam
jacere fundamenta Ecclesiae. Sed die sequenti,¹
inchoata fabrica coepit corruere, et pene tota
corruit. Tunc vir Dei in spiritu vidit juxta.
divinae praeordinationis dispositionem, locum
non esse a Deo destinatum, ad aedem sacram,
sed ad aulam regiam in eo extruendam. Prae-
vidit enim celebrem illum Hiberniae regem,
Domnaldum, Aido Ainmirii filio natum, post
tempora in eo loco sedem fixurum.''—ii. 111,
